# Progress

## What Works

### ‚úÖ Production Extraction Pipeline (Completed 2025-10-31)
- **Canonical dataset path**: `data/processed/preprocessed.jsonl`
- **Production scripts**:
  - `queue_extraction_prefect.py` - Orchestrated with Prefect (recommended)
  - `run_direct_extraction.py` - Direct execution without Prefect
- Both use proper heuristics-first multi-tier extraction pipeline
- **Preprocessing**: `scripts/preprocess.py` with streaming, deduplication, canonicalization

### ‚úÖ Prefect Migration (Completed 2025-10-25)
- Removed all Temporal services from docker-compose.yml
- Added Prefect stack (prefect-db, prefect-redis, prefect-server, prefect-agent)
- Updated API to use Prefect client instead of Temporal
- Created deployment and queueing scripts
- Benefits: Simpler, faster, more reliable than Temporal

### ‚úÖ spaCy EntityRuler Integration
- Custom pipeline with 4,505+ taxonomy patterns
- EntityRuler runs BEFORE statistical NER (taxonomy-first approach)
- Tested successfully: 5 entities extracted from sample text
- Performance: ~1,658 chars/second
- GPU acceleration available (RTX 3060, CUDA 13.0)

### ‚úÖ Extraction Implementation
- Heuristics loader with 4,505 entries:
  - 3,361 companies
  - 52 countries
  - 20 tech terms
  - 1,072 products
- Multi-tiered extraction: heuristics (0.90) ‚Üí regex (0.92) ‚Üí spaCy (0.70)
- MONEY and PERCENT regex patterns
- Proximity-based relationships
- Additional entity coverage: BUSINESS_TITLE, SKILL, TIME_RANGE, TEMPORAL (pattern-based)
- ORL relationships persisted with head/tail entity resolution
- Prefect flow now streams JSONL input (no memory blow-ups) and writes checkpoints compatible with DB schema

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure
- Database: 8 tables + pgvector 0.8.1
- GPU: CUDA available (RTX 3060)
- Test data: test_10.jsonl with 5 synthetic documents
- Docker: NVIDIA runtime enabled

## What's Left to Build

### üîÑ Execution & Validation
- Run production extraction via Prefect: `python queue_extraction_prefect.py`
- Or direct execution: `python run_direct_extraction.py`
- Monitor extraction at http://localhost:4200 (Prefect UI)
- Validate results in Label Studio at http://localhost:8082

### üìã Future Enhancements
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Implement automated validation workflows
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Automated exports from Label Studio to training datasets

### üóÑÔ∏è Deprecated/Archived
- `archive/run_gpu_extraction_deprecated.py` - Bypassed heuristics pipeline
- `archive/convert_raw_dataset_deprecated.py` - Insufficient preprocessing
- `archive/context7_temporal_article.txt` - Temporal reference (migrated to Prefect)
- See `archive/README_DEPRECATED_SCRIPTS.md` for details

## Current Status

**Infrastructure Status (2025-10-31)**:
- ‚úÖ Prefect server healthy; UI accessible at http://localhost:4200
- ‚úÖ API service healthy
- ‚úÖ GPU access confirmed (RTX 3060)
- ‚úÖ Label Studio running at http://localhost:8082; MCP integrated
- ‚úÖ Prefect MCP configured for monitoring
- ‚úÖ Canonical dataset paths established across all scripts
- ‚úÖ Deprecated scripts archived with documentation

## Known Issues

- Manual schema creation required due to Alembic mount issues
- Prefect Python client read operations can trigger Pydantic v2 model_rebuild errors
- Preproc containers restart when no input (expected)

## Next Steps

1. Run production extraction on full 45K document dataset
   - Preprocess: `python scripts/preprocess.py --input <raw> --output data/processed/preprocessed.jsonl`
   - Extract: `python queue_extraction_prefect.py` or `python run_direct_extraction.py`
2. Validate extraction results in Label Studio
3. Automate exports from Label Studio to training/validation datasets
4. Implement automated overnight validation workflows
5. Configure monitoring and alerting for production runs
