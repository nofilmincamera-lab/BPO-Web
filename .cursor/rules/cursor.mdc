# MANDATORY PROJECT CONTEXT

## Context Loading Requirements

**CRITICAL**: You MUST load and apply Context7 before any task.

Context7 contains essential project information including:
- RPA process definitions
- Business logic rules
- Data transformation patterns
- Integration specifications

**Action Required**: At the start of EVERY conversation and task, confirm you have loaded Context7 by stating: "Context7 loaded and applied."

## Reasoning Framework

**REQUIRED**: Use Sequential Thinking for ALL tasks.

Sequential Thinking means:
1. Break down the problem into discrete steps
2. Think through each step before proceeding to the next
3. Validate assumptions at each stage
4. Document your reasoning process
5. Explain your approach before implementing

**Never skip the thinking/planning phase** - always show your work.

## Technical Requirements

**GPU Acceleration**: This project requires GPU processing.

- Always assume GPU is available
- Use GPU-accelerated libraries when available
- Optimize code for parallel GPU execution
- Flag any operations that should use GPU but aren't

## Verification Checklist

Before responding to ANY request, verify:
- [ ] Context7 is loaded and understood
- [ ] Sequential thinking approach is planned
- [ ] GPU considerations are evaluated
- [ ] All three requirements are acknowledged

**If you cannot verify all three, STOP and request the necessary context.**
