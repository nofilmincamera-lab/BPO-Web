# Progress

## What Works

### ‚úÖ Prefect Migration (Completed 2025-10-25)
- Removed all Temporal services from docker-compose.yml
- Added Prefect stack (prefect-db, prefect-redis, prefect-server, prefect-agent)
- Updated API to use Prefect client instead of Temporal
- Created deployment and queueing scripts
- Benefits: Simpler, faster, more reliable than Temporal

### ‚úÖ spaCy EntityRuler Integration
- Custom pipeline with 4,505+ taxonomy patterns
- EntityRuler runs BEFORE statistical NER (taxonomy-first approach)
- Tested successfully: 5 entities extracted from sample text
- Performance: ~1,658 chars/second
- GPU acceleration available (RTX 3060, CUDA 13.0)

### ‚úÖ Extraction Implementation
- Heuristics loader with 4,505 entries:
  - 3,361 companies
  - 52 countries
  - 20 tech terms
  - 1,072 products
- Multi-tiered extraction: heuristics (0.90) ‚Üí regex (0.92) ‚Üí spaCy (0.70)
- MONEY and PERCENT regex patterns
- Proximity-based relationships
- Additional entity coverage: BUSINESS_TITLE, SKILL, TIME_RANGE, TEMPORAL (pattern-based)
- ORL relationships persisted with head/tail entity resolution
- Prefect flow now streams JSONL input (no memory blow-ups) and writes checkpoints compatible with DB schema

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure
- Database: 8 tables + pgvector 0.8.1
- GPU: CUDA available (RTX 3060)
- Test data: test_10.jsonl with 5 synthetic documents
- Docker: NVIDIA runtime enabled

## What's Left to Build

### üîÑ Execution & Validation
- Run direct GPU extraction: `python run_gpu_extraction.py`
- (Optional) Run via Prefect UI when monitoring is desired
- Spin up Label Studio for human validation and curation

### üìã Future Enhancements
- Archive old Temporal code to archive/temporal/
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Implement automated validation workflows
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## Current Status

**Infrastructure Status (2025-10-30)**:
- ‚úÖ Prefect server healthy; UI accessible at http://localhost:4200 (cosmetic 0.0.0.0 banner)
- ‚úÖ API service healthy
- ‚úÖ GPU access confirmed (RTX 3060)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DB auth error in direct runner (password for postgres); results not persisted
- ‚úÖ Label Studio running at http://localhost:8082; MCP wired into Cursor
- üîú Prefect MCP to be added to Cursor for monitoring/inspection

## Known Issues

- Manual schema creation required due to Alembic mount issues
- Prefect Python client read operations can trigger Pydantic v2 model_rebuild errors
- Preproc containers restart when no input (expected)

## Next Steps

1. Add Prefect MCP to `.cursor/mcp.json`; verify connection to local server
2. Fix DB auth for direct runner writes; backfill entities/relationships
3. Decide steady-state orchestration path (Prefect vs direct) per environment
4. Automate exports from Label Studio to training/validation datasets
5. Register Docker, Sequential Thinking, Context7 MCP entries when endpoints/packages are finalized
