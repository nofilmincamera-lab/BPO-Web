They extract insights from customer data and enhance workflows with co-pilot and auto-pilot features, letting humans focus on complex activities. \nWhat are the key challenges in implementing AI & GenAI? \nScaling AI and GenAI is not plug-and-play but requires data consolidation, governance, integration with legacy systems, change management and upskilling. A clear CX strategy, strong compliance framework, and a phased roadmap are key to prove tangible ROI. \nHow do AI-driven solutions personalize customer experiences? \nBy analyzing real-time behavioral, transactional, and contextual data across all channels, AI solutions personalize CX and provide hyper-relevant interactions - whether through digital nudging, personalized scripts for agents, or even full automation of simple journeys. \nHow does Konectas AI technology transform customer experience? \nKonectas AI and GenAI suite blends AI autonomy with human oversight. Our hybrid agentic model supports agents with co-pilot - real-time with nudges, scripts, and task automation - and auto-pilot capabilities - routine inquiries - for faster resolutions, consistent experiences, and measurable impact on NPS, FCR, and cost-to-serve. \nHow does Konecta balance AI automation with the human touch in CX? \nKonectas hybrid agentic framework amplifies, not replaces, humans. AI handles repetitive tasks, while humans manage complex or emotionally sensitive cases. Real-time co-pilot guides, without controlling, and preserves agent empathy and judgment. This synergy empowers agents, and boosts engagement, and trust with customers. \nCan Konectas AI help businesses improve response times? \nKonectas AI stack is designed to reduce Average Handling Time (AHT), without compromising quality, by automating task execution, pre-populating forms, and delivering real-time agent guidance. Auto-pilot solutions handle up to 50% of inbound contacts autonomously, while co-pilot reduces time spent on routine processes like call summarization or compliance checks. \nIts time to push for better \nAcross the world, Konectas teams are successfully reinventing brands and businesses relationships and improving their customer experience.

attrition\nHome\nCase Studies\nFintech accelerates agent training speed and puts the brakes on attrition\nHow did a fintech accelerate agent training speed and put the brakes on attrition at the same time?\nThe goal\nTo reduce the time to competence for new-hire agents in the German market, lower agent attrition rates, and streamline approaches to learning and development across its ecosystem of outsourcing partners.\nThe outcome\n25%\nreduction in time to competence\n82\nweeks cumulative cost savings\n0%\nattrition after 90 days\nThe challenge\nOne of the first fintechs, our client is the German division of a ground-breaking U.S.-headquartered, multinational online payment and money transfer company that was instrumental in the development of e-commerce and that today provides its services to consumers and businesses of all sizes.\nDemand for the clients services in Germany is at a record high, so much so that it was struggling to recruit and train sufficient agents to provide B2B and B2C CX support. One of the challenges to expanding its CX operations in line with its growing customer base was the time taken to train new recruits. With its existing approach, it took 16 working days for a newly hired agent to be able to go live and start resolving customer issues.\nAnother sizable issue was the fact that it was seeing an agent attrition rate of 24% within the first 90 days and 45% the following 90 days. A third problem was that because the client uses an ecosystem of CX delivery partners, each of those providers was potentially delivering that initial agent training in a different way.\nThe solution\nSupport delivered from Germany to B2B and B2C customers in the German market\nLanguage\nGerman\nOur client asked our learning and development team  who had been instrumental in designing the existing training materials  to evaluate the current situation and propose a new training approach that would help address these challenges and that could be adopted by its other CX delivery partners. Within six weeks, our team developed a solution called the Early Bird approach.\nHow it works\nThe Early Bird approach uses tenured agents to deliver structured daily mentoring to reinforce theoretical aspects of new-hire training. In doing so it:\nHelps to minimize the fear of failure new hires often have\nIncreases confidence in using tools and processes\nMakes topics easier to understand and absorb\nCreates a supportive learning environment\nImproves team dynamics and creates strong collegial bonds\nResults\n25%\nreduction in time to competence\n82\nweeks cumulative cost savings\n0%\nattrition after 90 days\nAs it takes just 12 working days to complete, the Early Bird approach is 25% faster than our clients existing method. But as well as being faster, Early Bird agents are better prepared.

Serving nearly 3 million customers, primarily in the U.S, Quicken enables users to track spending, budgeting, investments, and financial goals across multiple institutions.\nChallenges\nHigh seasonal call volumes and a legacy IVR created a negative experience for a customer base who resisted new technology and preferred the phone\nSolution\nAn AI agent that provides frictionless support and answers FAQs for customers while accurately routing to and assisting agents when calls have to be escalated\nResult\nQuickens containment rate has now quadrupled since launching PolyAI, with 2,500 calls resolved daily and not a single customer complaint\nChallenge\nQuicken has built its reputation on helping individuals achieve and maintain financial health. However, the company found itself facing critical operational and demographic challenges in its customer service function.\nOne of the most pressing challenges stemmed from the highly seasonal nature of Quickens support operations. While they typically staff around 200 agents, call volumes surge dramatically around year-endoften requiring over 300 agents to handle upward of 12,000 calls per week. This fluctuation made staffing complex and costly, especially given the legacy IVR systems in place, which relied on outdated call routing menus that often sent users to the wrong support lines, exacerbating wait times and frustration.\nAdditionally, Quickens core customer base, largely made up of Baby Boomers and Gen X, have traditionally been resistant to technological change. Before implementing PolyAI, every single customer call was handled by a human agent. This meant that even straightforward requests like password resets or refund queries tied up valuable agent time. Quicken needed to find a scalable, customer-first solution that performed as well as a human.\n\"At first there was pushback internally that this wouldn't work. Knowing that our customer base was more mature, we needed to be sure a solution like this could be a benefit to them.\" \nSolution\nFrom the outset, Quicken evaluated AI vendors with a focus on trust, transparency, and strategic alignment. Anything introduced into the customer experience had to be genuinely helpful and never obstructive. PolyAI stood out not only because of its robust voice AI technology, but because of its willingness to collaborate closely and co-own the outcome.\nQuickens AI agent, named Lisa, was designed to provide frictionless and transparent support to callers. Rather than replacing agents, Lisa handles repetitive queries, such as refund requests and step-by-step product troubleshooting, while seamlessly transferring more complex or sensitive calls to live agents. This accurate routing is essential for both customer satisfaction and agent efficiency. Lisa clearly introduces herself as a digital assistant, setting the right expectations upfront with customers and offering a smooth handoff when needed.\nBeyond customer experience, Quicken and PolyAI have also worked together to improve agent satisfaction and efficiency. The AI agent integrates into the agent desktop to automatically surface relevant customer information, pre-fill CRM fields, and suggest appropriate responses all while the agent focuses solely on the conversation. Agents should focus on providing a warm and productive customer experience, not be distracted scribbling down notes.\nThis dual-pronged approach, supporting both customers and agents, has created a more seamless and efficient experience across the board.\n2500 \nDaily resolved calls\n0 \nCustomer complaints since launch\nSince deploying PolyAI, Quicken has seen positive results. With a focus on careful expansion, their call containment rate has grown from 5% at launch to 21% a year later, meaning more than one in five customer calls are now fully resolved by the AI assistant without needing human intervention. Quicken is targeting beyond 30% within the next year, progress they didnt envision when this project was kicked off.\nLisa engages with every caller, amounting to hundreds of thousands of interactions and up to 2,500 calls per day during peak seasons. Customers appreciate the ease and speed of getting simple tasks resolved, while agents benefit from lower call volumes and better-prepared conversations. The agent assist tools have also increased their efficiency and job satisfaction, reducing attrition rates.\nLisa, our AI agent, is a representative of Quicken. She represents Quicken as much as I do.  \nIan Roberts\nDirector of Technology and Operations, Quicken\nFuture Plans\nLooking ahead, Quickens roadmap with PolyAI includes deepening agent enablement through further automation and real-time guidance. The long-term vision is to train new agents more effectively by offloading technical complexity to AI, allowing them to focus on human connection.\nQuicken is also working with PolyAI to deploy multilingual support, increased self-service sophistication, and additionally complex use cases like cancellations and renewals.\n Implementing PolyAI has upped the game. When I have somebody else from another industry call me and ask me how we are doing it the right way, who could ask for more? \nIan Roberts\nDirector of Technology and Operations, Quicken",

volume was consistently high, the bank also experienced regular peaks, corresponding with special offers. Increasing concerns around the rising cost of living meant more customers than ever before were calling to ask questions and carry out transactions. A combination of high call volume and limited agents to handle complex engagements meant customers were often\nrouted to the wrong department, causing increased wait times. As a result, the banks CSAT began to suffer.\nThe bank invested in online self-service to reduce pressure on the contact center, including a chatbot that encouraged customers to complete tasks online.

When we heard PolyAIs solution in Croatian, we knew that was what we wanted for our customers. No other vendors came close to how great it sounded, said Vedran. UniCredits voice assistant is now the first to be deployed in Croatian. The UniCredit team had forecast the project would take a year to deploy, but PolyAI deployed their voice assistant in just 3 months.\nThe voice assistant answers a range of frequently asked questions about things including card activation, card replacement, how to add a card to a digital wallet on a smartphone, and support queries for online banking. For call types that it doesnt yet automate, it routes callers straight to the right department, asking clarifying questions when needed.\nWhen we heard PolyAIs solution in Croatian, we knew that was what we wanted for our customers.

The DSAT has four stages: analysis, design, delivery, and assurance.\nThe benefits \nOur expertise in business change and learning and development empowered the MOD business unit with: \nA comprehensive training needs analysis that complied with organizational policies. \nIncreased readiness for upcoming organizational change and operating model design to enable transformation success. \nA breakdown of training objectives and solutions for each MOD role, providing opportunities to streamline delivery and enable time and cost savings. \nKnowledge transfer to empower internal training needs analysis in the future. \nRecommendations of future training needs to integrate innovative emerging technology solutions into the organization.\nIncreased readiness for upcoming organizational change and operating model design.\nOpportunities to streamline training deliveryenabling time and cost savings.\nConducting a comprehensive training needs analysis \nTo comply with the DSAT process, all MOD roles must have documented role statements. These provide detailed and accurate evidence of peoples responsibilities, enabling effective training design, resource planning and financial forecasts. Our business change experts were therefore engaged to conduct a detailed analysis of the roles, skills and responsibilities required to support the MOD business units future operating model. The goal was to use this data to design and shape optimal training solutions to ensure successful change implementation, while also developing a thorough understanding of each role to comply with the DSAT. The MOD also wanted to better understand the knowledge and skills its people would need to develop in the future to effectively perform tasks with the introduction of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). \nOur approach \nOur team developed a holistic strategy for completing a training needs analysis (TNA) tailored to the MOD business units goals. We gathered the initial essential insights through desk-side interviews, and meticulously analyzed the findings to identify training gaps and define clear training objectives. Then, by examining additional role-related insights beyond individual responsibilities, we were able to accurately determine the appropriate training solutions for each of the MOD business units roles.\nDesigning optimized training solutions \nOur analysis of the role responsibilities highlighted where teams and individual roles had shared tasks, enabling us to design optimal training methods. \nWe identified where the MOD business unit could standardize the delivery of bespoke training for these common tasksthereby, streamlining its processes. This would ensure the adoption of best practices, minimize the risk of errors across teams and enable significant time and cost savings in training delivery. \nThe proposed solutions considered future training requirements, such as the potential integration of AI and ML. We also advised on how to prepare and understand applications of emerging technologies while balancing the associated risks. \nReady to embrace organizational change \nThe TNA was crucial for informing leadership of the required training to enable their transformation success. Our approach ensured all documentation aligned with defense requirements and policies, and facilitated knowledge transfer so the MOD can complete any future TNAs internally for the business unit. \nBased upon our evidence-based decision making, the MOD was empowered to minimize staff skill gaps and effectively allocate finances for the complex change process. The client redesigned its operating model accordingly and increased its readiness for the upcoming organizational change. \nHaving worked together to prepare its people for organizational change, the MOD business unit progressed with confidence in its ability to achieve the transformation objectives set out at the beginning of the program.", "source_url": "https://www.cgi.com/en/case-study/government/helping-ministry-defence-prepare-staff-organizational-change"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2899, "end": 2922, "text": "artificial intelligence", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2950, "end": 2952, "text": "ML", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4092, "end": 4094, "text": "ML", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3133, "end": 3141, "text": "insights", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3318, "end": 3326, "text": "insights", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "University of Salford enhances broadcast training with CGI dira\nThe University of Salford is a dynamic institution known for its innovation in teaching, research and industry collaboration.

Shes a parent trying to help her son sort out a missing 1098-T tax form so he can finish his FAFSA. The line crackles. Still waiting. She sighs and checks the time again. Its been twenty minutes, and shes got back-to-back meetings all morning. She wonders if she should just give up and call again tomorrow. But tax deadlines dont wait.\nScenes like this played out across ECSIs contact centers every winter and summer. Agents jumped from tax form questions to refund issues to complex loan servicing calls, many of which came from frustrated parents trying to navigate the process on behalf of their kids.\nFor the ECSI team, this was more than a temporary spike. These volume surges hit hard with no end in sight. Hiring to meet seasonal demand had become nearly impossible, and their legacy IVR couldnt keep up.\nECSI is a leading provider of accounts receivable management for campus-based student loans. In 2022 alone, they fielded nearly 1.4 million calls across three contact centers. The pressure on staff was relentless, and leadership knew something had to change.\n\"Automation has become integral to what we do. Our business is dramatically different today with Replicant,\" said Mike Bowman, former Senior Director of Operations at ECSI. \"Its really made a difference in our employees lives and the experience from the borrowers and parents who call us, as well as how we run our business.\" \nAI at the front desk, built for the rush\nBowman led the search for a solution that could scale on demand, maintain a high-touch experience, and reduce the burden on his agents. After evaluating multiple vendors, ECSI chose Replicants AI agents to serve as their automated front desk. The AI agents authenticate callers, capture intents, and resolve or route calls across their three most seasonal products: tax form processing, refunds, and loan servicing.\nReplicants AI agents were deployed to handle call spikes while surfacing insights that had never been visible before. The implementation was collaborative, transparent, and fast. ECSIs team was involved in every step to make sure the solution reflected the realities of their business.\nHow it worked:\nContained and routed calls for tax forms, refunds, and loan servicing\nAuthenticated customers up front to save agents time\nIdentified caller intents and delivered real-time insights\nEnabled unlimited scalability during seasonal peaks\n\"Last year's biggest win for us wasn't just the $1.5 million dollars we saved with automation,\" said Bowman. \"Replicants AI agents were really good at showing us what we weren't doing well. Its collecting information to show us what are the obstacles, where people are getting stuck. We can use that data to design a better process, to design a better website, to start new solutions.\"\nImmediate tax help without the hold music\nToday, when someone like Julie calls with a question about a tax form, Replicants AI agents answer ECSIs front desk 24/7 with no wait times. They greet every caller instantly, authenticate them, and handle routine requests or route them to the right place with a full summary in hand.\nEven when a call is escalated, agents no longer have to repeat steps or dig for context. That means faster conversations, smoother resolutions, and less burnout. And because every interaction is logged and categorized, ECSI now uses insights from Replicant to improve their website, optimize self-service tools, and proactively address friction.\nECSI also surveyed customers to understand how this new experience felt. The results were clear, satisfaction was just as high whether callers spoke with a human agent or an AI agent.\nTransformational results:\n1.5 million dollars in annual savings\n40 percent decrease in escalation handle times\n70 percent faster agent response times\n\"The reason you got our business is because you're honest, straightforward and responsive,\" said Bowman. \"You were very inclusive with my team, showing them how things work and making them part of the build process. There was just a lot of transparency, openness, and honesty. You would hope this isn't true, but you just don't see that everywhere.\"\nIndustry\nFinancial services\nPain point\nSeasonal call spikes\nAbout the company\nECSI provides a full range of customizable solutions in support of the entire lifecycle of higher education and post-graduation.

She was tired, starving, and not in the mood to cook. She ordered her usual burrito from a local spot that wasnt on the DoorDash app. The system placed a call to the restaurant to confirm it. But when someone picked up, the kitchen noise made it hard to hear. The line cut out. Her dinner never came.\nDoorDash runs a massive, always-moving ecosystem with over 500,000 merchants, five million Dashers, and tens of millions of customers. But in 2019, too many phone-based food orders were being placed inefficiently by offshore call centers. This led to missed revenue and rising operational costs. Cancellations and escalations added to the load. In 2023, a new challenge emerged on the Dasher side. A spike in tax-related calls overwhelmed systems every January.\nIn both cases, DoorDash needed a way to scale instantly without hiring seasonal agents or expensive BPOs. So they turned to Replicant.\n\"Our goal was to find a high quality solution to handle the erratic demand of our phone order traffic, while minimizing escalations and continuing to lower the costs,\" said George McConnell, Former Global Operations Manager at DoorDash.\nClear calls, hot meals\nDoorDash first partnered with Replicant to automate outbound food ordering. This was a tedious, high-volume task that was essential to customer satisfaction but difficult to scale. Replicants AI agents were designed to clearly and succinctly communicate order details, even through background noise, unique accents, or voicemail trees. The goal was to match or outperform human agents in resolution, speed, and clarity.\nReplicants AI agents also tested and optimized how and when to retry calls that went to voicemail or came back busy. This dramatically reduced order failure rates and brought formerly disengaged merchants back into the flow.\nIn 2023, DoorDash expanded the partnership again. This time they automated a massive volume of outbound tax form verification calls. The campaign launched in just two weeks and scaled to over 2,000 concurrent calls at peak. Dashers got the support they needed faster. DoorDash avoided hiring hundreds of seasonal agents during the holiday crunch.\n\"Replicant was able to meet or exceed our goals across all major metrics but more importantly, our partner restaurants preferred the AI solution,\" said McConnell. \"During our initial pilot we spoke with numerous merchants who explained they preferred speaking with the AI agent since the kitchen is often noisy and the robot is clear.\" \nFaster service, full satisfaction\nIn just six weeks, Replicants AI agents were placing over 35,000 food orders per day. Resolution rates climbed. Escalations dropped. Customer satisfaction went up. Operational efficiency did too.\nFor the tax season campaign, Replicant handled nearly 800,000 calls in just eight days and saved more than 2.5 million agent minutes. That kind of scale would have been impossible with live support alone.\nNow when someone like Nina places an order after a long shift, it goes through. Even if the kitchen is loud, the restaurant gets the call, the order is placed clearly, and the food shows up hot. Fewer missed meals. Fewer dropped calls. More satisfied customers at the end of their day.\nDoorDash now uses Replicants AI agents as a flexible, always-on extension of their team. It delivers cost savings and faster service without sacrificing experience.\nTransformational results:\nOutbound food ordering\n350,000+ calls automated per day\n87 percent resolution rate\n6 weeks from kick-off to launch\n0-minute hold times\nIndustry\nConsumer Services\nPain point\nOutbound calling\nAbout the company\nDoorDash is one of the world's leading local commerce platforms that helps businesses of all kinds grow and innovate, connects consumers to the best of their neighborhoods, and gives people fast, flexible ways to earn.

With so many players in the market, customers evaluate and compare, looking for the best expertise, investment track record, and service experience. One key to a superior experience is the customer onboarding journey. Customers want to be onboarded easily, quickly, and securelywithout any errors, delays, or risks.\nAs finance organizations look for new ways to drive strategic value from artificial intelligence (AI), a global asset management firm turned to CGI to raise its customer onboarding to a new level. CGI delivered an AI-driven anomaly detection solution that improved the quality and efficiency of the firms customer onboarding journey, saving it millions of dollars per year, reducing customer churn, and more.\nThe challenges of rules-based anomaly detection\nThe firms former customer onboarding process was completely rules-based. Pre-defined rules determined which types of anomalies could be detected and the point at which quality control kicked in (e.g., when customer accounts valued at $50,000 or more are opened). Anomalies beyond the perimeters of the rules were missed. Further, anomalies that typically have a very low failure rate would still trigger quality control, costing time and money.\nIn addition, even as human behaviors, forms, processes, etc. in onboarding changed, the rules stayed the same. As a result, new anomalies resulting from any changes went undetected.\nUndetected errors (e.g., wrong type of account opened) resulting from this rules-based approach led to customer calls, delays, manual rework, and customer churn. Further, it posed financial risks. If an error, for example, resulted in the wrong stock being purchased for a customer, the asset management firm would be liable for any financial repercussions.\nMillions of dollars\nare now saved every year\nShifting to AI-driven anomaly detection\nCGI implemented a machine-learning solution for the firm that gathers and analyzes metadata across the entire onboarding process; for example, historical and recent data related to how, when, and where new accounts are opened. Through this data and the use of multiple AI analysis models at different points along the onboarding life cycle, the solution can predict potential account opening failures, despite the tremendous volume of data and the fact that most account openings are error free.\nBecause its AI-driven and not limited by rules, the solution also can detect any type of error in onboardingexisting or new. It can even detect errors that have never been contemplated. For example, in its analysis of onboarding metadata, the solution uncovered the fact that more onboarding errors are made by personnel near the time of lunch or at the end of the workdaya human behavior issue the firm could now address.\nSaving millions and satisfying customers through improved onboarding\nThrough AI-driven anomaly detection, the firm now detects more onboarding errors and better manages quality control triggers, resulting in a smoother, faster customer onboarding journey. The outcome of this transformation is saving millions of dollars per year and ensuring fewer customer calls and churn. Another benefit is improved data quality and reliability using AI.\nIn terms of delivery, the CGI team delivered on time and on budget.

Pot generated $250k from after hours bookings with PolyAI\nThe Melting Pot is a casual dining franchise of fondue restaurants based out of Tampa, Florida. They have more than 90 locations across the United States and Canada.\nChallenges\nStaff overwhelmed during peak operating hours and an inability to answer calls after hours, leading to missed booking calls and lost revenue opportunities.\nSolution\nAn always available AI agent that is scalable across each location and equipped to drive revenue by ensuring booking calls are not missed.\nResult\n$250k generated from after hours bookings, as well as 68% automation of all reservation calls.\nChallenge\nThe Melting Pot faced several operational challenges, most notably with reservation management. Restaurant staff were overwhelmed during peak operating hours, leading to missed booking calls and lost revenue opportunities. This problem was exacerbated outside of business hours, with further bookings missed.\nThey needed an AI agent to be always available, scalable across each location, and equipped to drive revenue by ensuring booking calls were not missed. The solution also needed to reduce the burden on staff by handling routine guest requests with a welcoming experience.\nThe selected partner would need to integrate with OpenTable, a significant driver of reservations for the Melting Pot.\n\"We felt like we were losing revenue opportunities due to missed booking calls and needed a solution. PolyAI is a recommended vendor of OpenTable and, thanks to the quality of their technology and dedication of their team , they validated our assumption and worked to find a solution that would help.\" \nSolution\nLooking to cement its place as an early technology adopter in the restaurant space, the Melting Pot partnered with PolyAI to implement an AI agent to transform their operations. Available at all times, including after hours, the PolyAI agent, named Judy, has significantly enhanced the Melting Pots operating model to never miss a call and ensure each interaction provides an engaging brand experience.\nGuests can now create, edit, or cancel reservations, as well as make a booking deposit, all with the PolyAI agent. These capabilities have generated additional revenue opportunities for the Melting Pot that would have previously been missed due to unanswered phone calls.\nThe PolyAI agent can also answer routine questions from customers, including restaurant location, opening hours, and menu options. This further removes workload strain from restaurant staff, and gives them the time back to focus on providing the perfect night out for guests.\nWhats more, the PolyAI agent can promote and provide information on OpenTable experiences, including menus for special occasions, wine pairings, and the ability to request specific table locations. This integration provides an even more seamless and rich experience for guests.\n$250k \nRevenue generated from after hours bookings\n68% \nAutomation of all reservation calls\n55% \nOf calls removed from front desk staff\nThe implementation of the PolyAI agent has led to remarkable improvements in the Melting Pots operations and guest experiences. During the first 6 months of site rollout, $250k of revenue was generated from after hours bookings, opportunities that might have previously been missed. Additionally, the AI agent automates 68% of all reservation-related calls, maximizing revenue generation by empowering customers to make reservations and have their questions answered. In fact, over half of all calls made to restaurants are answered by the PolyAI agent. \nOverall, the PolyAI agent has generated significant cost savings for the Melting Pot and increased the efficiency of the table booking process. It has been welcomed by guests and staff alike, especially by front-of-house employees who can more fully focus on creating satisfying restaurant experiences. The teams also know that, if a call does come through, it will likely be a high value interaction (e.g. large group booking) instead of a routine request that didnt need their attention. \nLocations can go live with a branded, pre-trained voice assistant extremely quickly which, for our restaurants, means less time working on technology and more time delivering the perfect night out for our guests.\" \nRandy Barnett\nChief Technology Officer, Melting Pot\nOpenTable Partnership\nThe Melting Pot was the first restaurant to go live for new bookings with the PolyAI and OpenTable partnership. This has expanded to include cancellations, rescheduling, and confirming bookings, as well as experiences through OpenTable. The result of this partnership has been both an increase and simplification of the table booking process for both the Melting Pot and OpenTable.\nMore information on the PolyAI & OpenTable partnership can be found here.", "source_url": "https://poly.ai/case-studies/melting-pot/"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 31, "end": 35, "text": "250k", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 47, "end": 52, "text": "hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 336, "end": 341, "text": "hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 563, "end": 567, "text": "250k", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 589, "end": 594, "text": "hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 616, "end": 619, "text": "68%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1896, "end": 1901, "text": "hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1927, "end": 1931, "text": "Judy", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1960, "end": 1977, "text": "the Melting Pots", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2452, "end": 2465, "text": "opening hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2910, "end": 2914, "text": "250k", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2945, "end": 2950, "text": "hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2960, "end": 2963, "text": "68%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3001, "end": 3004, "text": "55%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3181, "end": 3199, "text": "the first 6 months", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3218, "end": 3222, "text": "250k", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3259, "end": 3264, "text": "hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3366, "end": 3369, "text": "68%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4281, "end": 4286, "text": "night", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4309, "end": 4322, "text": "Randy Barnett", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 30, "end": 34, "text": "$250", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 562, "end": 566, "text": "$250", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2909, "end": 2913, "text": "$250", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3217, "end": 3221, "text": "$250", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "Expert DIY Advice from Generative AI | Bricorama Case Study\nCASE STUDY Bricorama \nBricoramas pAInt platform helps customers paint perfectly\n3-MINUTE READ\nJune 27, 2024\nGiving DIY customers confidence\nAs any DIYer will tell you, painting projects are rarely straightforward. From choosing the right color to visualizing how it will look while accounting for things like natural lighting, DIY painting is surprisingly complicated. But what if there was a way to make homeowners feel more confident about their choices, using digital technologies to enable people to try before they buy?\nThats exactly what French do-it-yourself retailer Bricorama has done, using generative AI (gen AI) to give customers expert advice on their painting projects. Named pAInt, this gen AI shopping assistant saves time, effort and money. Customers can simply describe their project and the platform will suggest paint colors, quantities and more.\nCustomers can simply visit bricorama.fr, create a user profile and log in to pAInt. The platforms advanced gen AI will start a conversation and ask questions about their painting project and the colors theyd like to use. From there, pAInt will suggest different color options, offer advice and tutorials, and provide color trends and pictures of similar projects to help them visualize the end result.\nAs pAInt is fully integrated with Bricoramas existing e-commerce systems, customers can easily add recommended products to their wishlist or basket. The platform also saves projects to user profiles so they can access them later, which is very handy when repainting a room as you can quickly find the exact color you used via your profile.\nA creative and responsible approach to AI\npAInt was built on Azure OpenAI Service and leveraged the natural language interaction and contextual understanding capabilities of ChatGPT services. Together with Bricoramas business and technology teams, we trained pAInt on Bricoramas propriety content and documents, such as paint can labels. This ensures pAInt can provide relevant suggestions for products available in-store or on the Bricorama website. Creative talent including copywriters and graphic designers developed the platforms voice and guidance messages, plus visual aspects such as style pictures, color examples and the user-friendly interface.\nWe also applied a responsible AI approach with safeguards to limit the platforms response to painting and home improvement information only and to ensure compliance with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\npAInt's impressive three-month milestones\nRobust module completion\n20% of users completed three pAInt experience modules and 50% completed at least two. \nContinued engagement\npAInt facilitates in-depth conversations with customers about their projects, averaging 17 messages per discussion.\nPrompt re-engagement\npAInt encouraged customers to return to their projects within 24 hours, indicating most customers wanted to mature their projects.\nAward-winning platform\npAInt has been recognized with a Silver award in the Generative AI category at the prestigious La Nuit des Rois in France.\nPainting a brighter future\nAs part of pAInts development Bricorama established new roles, monitoring processes and organizational structures in addition to processes for ongoing maintenance and improvement. While pAInt is currently an online tool, Bricorama plans to provide self-service access in-store and the retailers store designers have already begun to build this experience. Additionally, a dedicated version of pAInt is in development for vendors to help them better support clients.\nAn employee version is also in the works, and there are plans to expand the platform to include other home improvement categories and products in the future, such as bathroom and gardening. Its all part of Bricoramas effort to help pAInt become a trusted advisor for expert guidance on DIY projects.\nFor Bricorama, pAInt is supporting its goal to reposition its brand as the DIY champion of home improvement projects for French consumers. Ultimately, its driving brand awareness and increasing customer loyalty. pAInt has also showcased the potential for generative AI to enhance the customer experience and provide valuable guidance in unique decision-making processes.", "source_url": "https://www.accenture.com/us-en/case-studies/data-ai/bricorama-getting-diy-advice-genai"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label",

situation, Foundever proposed a multifaceted approach to rebuilding its CX operations that would realize initial quick wins  to lower the total cost of ownership, unlock efficiencies and protect the clients financial position  while delivering long-term improvements and additional value through the application of data analytics and automation.\nCost savings\nBy developing a comprehensive workforce forecasting and scheduling system, we gained a thorough understanding of the clients staffing needs. Using those findings, we organized a team that was primarily offshore and complemented with nearshore and work-at-home agents. This approach ensured smooth scaling during seasonal fluctuations while delivering significant cost savings through labor arbitrage. Being able to deliver part of the solution through our network of work-at-home agents also meant the client had access to talent closer to its retail and operations locations as needed.\nError rates\nUsing CX analytics, we identified common reasons for contact and issue scenarios, uncovering training gaps and areas for improvement. We delivered a calibrated Learning Management System (LMS), modernizing training and coaching that enabled performance improvement for agents. We achieved this by using customer insights to determine which courses and modules to prioritize. The LMS allowed us to cut existing training time by 10%.\nIntegration\nWe provided the client with our adaptable platform that combines a unified agent desktop (for a single view of each customer regardless of channel or query type), CRM functionality, cloud telephony, knowledge base, and IVR, which crucially integrates with existing applications, including the clients instance of Zendesk and other related CRM tools.\nAnalytics\nThrough our suite of CX analytics, we initially identified all common contact drivers and secondary intentions. As data volumes grew, we were able to automate customer sentiment categories and build out proactive agent coaching dashboards  for upselling and cross-selling, as well as faster issue resolution. This has enabled the client to reduce AHT by 305 seconds for voice calls and 442 seconds for chat sessions.\nAutomation\nInitial data and insights collection guided the deployment of an IVR that had an immediate positive impact in automating the resolution of 5% of phone calls into the contact center. Over 18 months, this reduced costs for voice contact by $2.2 million.\nWe added to this success with the development and deployment of a chatbot aimed at further lowering live chat contact volumes without lowering CX levels during peak demand. It could handle many common customer queries, provide recommendations and allow users to cancel orders. Its currently handling 66% of chat sessions and to date has returned $5.3 million in cost savings.", "source_url": "https://foundever.com/case-studies/a-leading-retailer-achieves-over-10-million-in-savings/"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 33, "end": 44, "text": "$10 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 158, "end": 165, "text": "Chatbot", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 555, "end": 569, "text": "data analytics", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 639, "end": 650, "text": "forecasting", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1626, "end": 1629, "text": "10%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1806, "end": 1809, "text": "CRM", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1825, "end": 1830, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1983, "end": 1986, "text": "CRM", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1994, "end": 2003, "text": "Analytics", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2359, "end": 2370, "text": "305 seconds", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2391, "end": 2402, "text": "442 seconds", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2450, "end": 2458, "text": "insights", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2572, "end": 2574, "text": "5%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2620, "end": 2629, "text": "18 months", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2671, "end": 2683, "text": "$2.2 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2986, "end": 2989, "text": "66%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3032, "end": 3044, "text": "$5.3 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 33, "end": 36, "text": "$10", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2671, "end": 2673, "text": "$2", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3032, "end": 3034, "text": "$5", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1710, "end": 1731, "text": "unified agent desktop", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1205, "end": 1217, "text": "CX analytics", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2025, "end": 2037, "text": "CX analytics", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1511, "end": 1519, "text": "insights", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "Global food brand boosts employee experience\nHome\nCase Studies\nGlobal food brand boosts employee experience and delivers CX in 80 languages\nHow did a global food brand learn to evaluate and apply AI translation to boost employee experience and deliver CX in 80 languages?\nThe goal\nTo create and maintain a sustainable, scalable approach to multilingual customer experience that balances brand integrity and high service quality while lowering operating costs and optimizing human resources for an improved employee experience.\nThe outcome\n81%\ndrop in agent attrition\n100%\nincrease in occupancy rates\nThe challenge\nOur client, a leading multinational food manufacturing company, was struggling to optimize the per-transaction costs of its existing approach to customer experience delivery across the U.K. and continental Europe. Its CX operations, which support 16 languages and are delivered by a 22-member team, were established primarily for customer engagements relating to product recalls, quality complaints or questions regarding promotions or campaigns. However, due to the high quality and consistency of its products, agents  particularly those assigned to smaller European markets  may go an entire workday without handling a single customer interaction.\nWhile an envious position to be in from a brand perception and quality perspective, in terms of employee experience and cost to serve, the situation was becoming unsustainable. Agent attrition rates stood at 6.5% and occupancy rates averaged 29%.\nOur client wanted a new approach that addressed these challenges, and while it was clear technology would be a key enabler of any proposed solution, due to the growing hype around its capabilities, the client was understandably skeptical about integrating AI into its operations without a clear use case and proof of concept.\nThe solution\nSupport delivered from the U.K. with 13 FTEs.\nChannel\nEmail\nLanguages\n80 languages including Arabic, Danish, English, French and German\nOur clients biggest concern about making technology and automation central to CX delivery was the potential loss of nuanced communication and specific vocabulary that conveyed its brand and created personalized interactions with customers across different European markets. To address this, we worked with the client to evaluate various tools, such as crowdsourced translation services, and leveraged our multilingual capabilities for linguistic accuracy benchmarking. This helped the client understand the strengths and limitations of each technological solution, providing a clear frame of reference for judging AI and its relative performance.\nThrough this evaluation process, we agreed on a customized real-time machine translation platform designed to embody the clients brand across all major European languages. The solution was integrated with the clients bespoke email-handling tool and introduced in a pilot phase over four months. During this period, the tool was set up to allow any agent to deliver native-language email responses in 10 European languages, calibrated to reflect the clients specific terminology and brand language. Each response generated was assessed for accuracy by native speakers across our network of multilingual CX hubs.\nWith consistent accuracy confirmed, the solution was soft launched across those markets, but without fanfare so that the change in approach wouldnt directly influence any deviation in CSAT figures or instances of direct customer complaints regarding service quality.\nResults\n81%\ndrop in agent attrition\n100%\nincrease in occupancy rates\nFollowing the initial rollout, the client saw CSAT scores rise from 94% to 96%. And, having seen how well the solution performed, increased the project scope to cover 80 languages, enabling it to expand operations to provide direct, native-language support to every European country.\nThe tools ease of use  typically, agents required less than one hours training  also allowed significant optimization and redeployment of resources. The CX team was reduced to 13 tenured agents, allowing former members to be absorbed elsewhere in our organization within roles that offered greater engagement and job satisfaction. The combination of team reduction and service expansion increased occupancy rates by 100% and saw attrition rates fall by 81%.\nThe impact has been so great that we are currently working with the client to assess the tools suitability as part of a similar solution for CX delivery in synchronous channels such as online chat.", "source_url": "https://foundever.com/case-studies/global-food-brand-boosts-employee-experience-and-delivers-cx-in-80-languages/"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 539, "end": 542, "text": "81%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "100%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1475, "end": 1479, "text": "6.5%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1509, "end": 1512, "text": "29%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2921, "end": 2932, "text": "four months", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3527, "end": 3530, "text": "81%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3555, "end": 3559, "text": "100%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3656, "end": 3666, "text": "94% to 96%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3924, "end": 3942, "text": "less than one hour", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4292, "end": 4296, "text": "100%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4329, "end": 4332, "text": "81%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3656, "end": 3659, "text": "94%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3663, "end": 3666, "text": "96%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "TaskUs Featured in AWS, Pinecone Case Study\nAWS highlighted TaskUs in its recent partner success story. \nTaskUs uses AWS AI and machine learning tools to deepen TaskGPT capabilities, our proprietary GenAI platform.

The company tracks the movement of physical goods across hundreds of nodesbeginning with the suppliers that make the component parts that power cloud servers. Those critical hardware components are shipped to Microsoft hubs, then routed to system integrators, which assemble servers based on specific demands. The completed servers are then placed in racks, which are in turn grouped into clusters. The clusters are stored in finished goods warehouses until they are sent to data centers around the world.\nThe scale and complexity of Microsofts global cloud supply chain network changed significantly in the last few years due to the rapid growth of the cloud. As a result, the supply chain team needed to reliably pinpoint the whereabouts of critical inventory across its network of partners and suppliers.\nWith millions of servers across over 200 physical datacenters and continuous expansion to keep up with customer demand, Microsoft needed to work smarter.\nWhen tech meets human ingenuity\nThe future of cloud collaboration\nMicrosoft and Accenture assembled a small team responsible for chartering the Control Tower solution vision by aligning on guiding principles:\nObsess over data quality.\nLeverage data and analytics to create a transformation roadmap, aligning to core objectives and key results (OKRs).\nDesign and build processes and interfaces collaboratively, leveraging human-centered design.\nPower cross-organization collaboration through technology.\nDesign for real-time data feeds using best-in-class Azure services.\nDeliver speed to value by using modular use case building blocks.\nBridge domain silos by building capabilities that span the supply chain.\nThe team set out to build the solution foundation, a digital twin data model that would serve as the single source of truth for the movement of physical goods across the Azure supply chain. This Azure-native architecture supported self-serve analytics, as well as bespoke control tower applications.\nThe team rolled out control tower minimum viable products (MVPs) around two critical domains. The first was an inventory-in-motion control tower to track and record the location of rack and data center components in transit and at rest. The second was an operational control tower, built to support the operations teams in coordinating the deployment of clusters to zones with the most pressing capacity needs.\nAccenture also tapped its global Supply Chain Control Tower experts to stand up a control tower center of excellence to maintain and improve data quality, provide technical support and monitor system and interface performance.\nAs the partnership progressed, both MVPs matured into full-feature releases. And Microsofts integrated Control Tower applications and architecture give its global teams a robust solution that can scale with its cloud business.\nA valuable difference\nAn enhanced experience for all\nToday, the Microsoft Cloud supply chains control tower operates as a single source of truth for more than 500 decision makers across multiple organizations and geographies. It has unlocked advanced analytics capabilities, with historical data driving continuous improvement and proactive risk management. Better alignment and coordination between users means that supply chain practitioners can focus their efforts on translating data into valuable insights and driving positive customer outcomes. This helps Microsoft ensure cloud capacity can meet demand and that disruptions can be identified and mitigated quickly.\nTo date, the Microsoft Cloud supply chain has seen marked improvements in employee efficiency, with hundreds of hours saved prepping data and chasing post-hoc analysis. The team expects to see significant dollars saved in reduced shipment expedites, along with increased expected cloud revenue through more efficient inventory management and distribution.\nLooking forward, Microsoft will continue to invest in intelligent response capabilities and end-to-end visibility throughout its supply chain network. The control towers flexibility leaves future possibilities opensuch as new data models that monitor scope 3 carbon emissions, enabling Microsoft to make climate-smart tradeoffs in real time.\nIn just one year, this control tower initiative introduced new ways of working for the Microsoft Cloud supply chainand operations teams and cloud customers alike are seeing nothing but blue skies ahead.", "source_url": "https://www.accenture.com/us-en/case-studies/software-platforms/microsoft-control-tower"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 124, "end": 129, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 157, "end": 165, "text": "5-minute", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 171, "end": 182, "text": "May 8, 2023", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 263, "end": 284, "text": "more than one billion", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 510, "end": 515, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 919, "end": 924, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 971, "end": 989, "text": "the last few years", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1021, "end": 1026, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1375, "end": 1380, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3193, "end": 3198, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3262, "end": 3267, "text": "Today", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3712, "end": 3720, "text": "insights", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3789, "end": 3794, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3982, "end": 3999, "text": "hundreds of hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4162, "end": 4167, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4585, "end": 4598, "text": "just one year", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4723, "end": 4728, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3452, "end": 3470, "text": "advanced analytics", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2917, "end": 2934, "text": "technical support", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "Amdocs Delivers a Telecom-Focused Autonomous Retail Store\nThe News: Amdocs announced in October that it had been selected by etisalat by e&, the telecoms pillar of e& in the United Arab Emirates, to deliver an autonomous in-store retail experience for its telecommunications customers. The autonomous retail store was designed and rolled out in partnership with Trigo, a computer vision technology company that provided cameras and smart shelves, to create a seamless checkout system experience. You can read the press release detailing the design and rollout of the autonomous store on the Amdocs website.\nAmdocs Delivers a Telecom-Focused Autonomous Retail Store\nAnalyst Take: Amdocs announced it had been selected by and delivered to etisalat by e&, the telecoms pillar of e& in the United Arab Emirates, an autonomous retail store for its customers in the Dubai. Created in partnership with Trigo, a computer vision company that provided customer tracking inside the store by supplying cameras and smart shelves, the autonomous retail store is designed to provide a frictionless shopping experience.\nCustomers can select their items from the shelves or a vending machine and then pay for their items anywhere inside the store using a specifically designed mobile app, kiosks, or at the exit gate. While inside the store, customers will receive real-time updates on their mobile cart as they pick up items, ensuring a personalized and seamless shopping experience.\nLeveraging Amdocs Integration Expertise to Power Friction-Free Shopping\nI spoke with Josh Koenig, Amdocs vice president of business services, and Alex Kishinevsky, lead solution architect with Amdocs, who discussed how Amdocs was able to use its expertise with integrating multiple third parties to handle all of the back-processes required to enable shopping autonomy.\nThis is where our background really was an effective part of why were actually able to make this store come to life, Koenig said. All the things we learned in the past from delivering our own technology has allowed us to seamlessly transition to deliver beyond Amdocs solutions. From how we manage vendors, create an integrated end to end plan, to how we integrate back to the biller, we put it all together to deliver beyond our product set and this store is kind of a culmination of all that.\nEnabling Personalization via Mobile QR Codes\nMuch of the automation of the in-store purchase process is made possible by the use of a mobile application equipped with mobile QR code functionality. When a customer enters the autonomous retail store, they simply need to open the mobile app and scan the mobile QR code at the entry gate. For etisalat-registered customers, there is a facial recognition feature for entering the store. This feature identifies the customer account while in the store and allows them to select items as they shop, automatically adding items to the apps mobile shopping cart. When they decide to leave the store, customers complete the purchase check out seamlessly, and the gates will open upon completion of the transaction.\nFurthermore, there is also a POS system at the gate, which also can accept payments, Kishinevsky said, noting that, If youre approaching the gate and you dont have anything or youve already paid for everything, then the system will recognize that, and the gate will open automatically, allowing you to exit.\nAccording to Kishinevsky, the autonomous store uses cameras and app integrations to track customers with non-biometrical technology, respecting customers privacy.\nAmdocs was able to move quickly from concept to store opening, in about 4 months, which was due to the experience and expertise of its services division with coordinating multiple partners. In addition, because the space used for the autonomous retail store was above etisalats office and in a standalone location, the team was able to work continuously to build and outfit the space instead of being constrained by typical retail project construction restrictions.\nSupport for Enhanced Capabilities in the Future\nAt present, the store supports a limited set of in-store customer journeys, but Koenig says that the next phase of the project is adding new capabilities now and into the future, incorporating additional capabilities on the platform. The key was that we wanted to be ready for the launch, so we had to be very picky with which use cases we used, Koenig said, noting that there are no limitations on future use cases. They could include the ability for a customer to check to see if an item is in stock, reserve it, and then pick up the item at the autonomous store, for example.\nAdditionally, the autonomous retail store likely will allow for the support of enhanced autonomous interactions. If a customer wants additional assistance with an item, they could interact with a generative AI-powered smartboard, allowing them to ask questions about an item in a natural way, Koenig says. If they require a human, they could then switch to a video connection with a real human working remotely, allowing the retailer to provide real human support with more flexibility and at a lower cost than physically staffing the store with service representatives.\nAll told, the launch of a telecom-focused autonomous retail store is an interesting way to test out and evaluate more vertically focused retail concepts. Because the store is linked to a user or member-focused account, it offers a greater ability to provide truly personalized journeys without requiring additional personal information or relying on intrusive biometric technology.\nDisclosure: The Futurum Group is a research and advisory firm that engages or has engaged in research, analysis, and advisory services with many technology companies, including those mentioned in this article.

This milestone underscores TELUS' commitment to ensuring the highest standards of privacy and data protection, while continuously innovating to deliver a best-in-class customer experience. It is the second such MSECB certification for TELUS, which became the first company in the world to secure the ISO 31700-1 Privacy by Design certification for its Data for Good program in October 2023.\nThe TELUS.com GenAI support tool, powered by Fuel iX, an enterprise-grade AI engine provided by TELUS International, is one of the first customer-accessible GenAI solutions developed by a Canadian organization. The support tool gives TELUS customers the ability to access fast and intuitive responses to their queries, providing them with a more convenient and seamless digital experience. Privacy by Design is a framework that proactively embeds privacy into the design and operation of systems, ensuring that privacy is the default setting. By achieving this certification, TELUS has continued to demonstrate its dedication to safeguarding user data and upholding the highest ethical standards in technology, including the use of AI.\n\"At TELUS, we believe that a responsible, ethical and human-centric approach to technology design and data stewardship is the only way to ensure that GenAI delivers on its potential to enable amazing outcomes, said Pam Snively, Chief Data & Trust Officer at TELUS. TELUS GenAI support tool is one example of how we are actively striving to deliver technology that truly puts customers first, delivering functional value and trustworthiness at the same time.\n[Learn more about Fuel iX's approach to Responsible AI here.] \nTo address concerns around and limitations of generative AI, TELUS has a comprehensive Responsible AI program in place and conducted a robust risk management assessment that included alignment with the ISED Voluntary Code of Conduct on the Responsible Development and Management of Advanced Generative AI Systems. TELUS also applies a collaborative and rigorous approach to testing its AI tools to reduce risks and improve accuracy, called Purple Teaming. This approach combines both adversarial testing, commonly known as red-teaming, with blue-teaming, that consists of innovative defensive techniques to effectively enable the company to identify weaknesses and confirm validity and robustness of an AI application. TELUS provides clear information on how the tool works, and how it doesnt work while also following a data ethics framework and continued monitoring of the system with human oversight.\nGenerative AI offers tremendous opportunities, but we also must be prudent about mitigating potential risks. User privacy is a key area of focus for TELUS and the Fuel iX software solution. The ISO Privacy by Design certification is a tangible validation of that commitment, said Tobias Dengel, President of WillowTree, a TELUS International Company and General Manager of Fuel iX.\nThe GenAI tools evaluation was conducted by KPMG, an international auditing and advisory firm, which reported its alignment with international privacy criteria and the requirements laid out in the ISO 31700-1 Privacy by Design Standard.\nAs an early adopter of GenAI and without the benefit of a body of precedents against which to measure its approach, TELUS has demonstrated a strong commitment to a human-centric approach with customer trust being a core priority, said Sylvia Klasovec Kingsmill, Partner, Global Cyber Privacy Services Leader, KPMG. As this is a rapidly evolving space, we encourage TELUS to continue its leadership in this area through broad-based, multi-stakeholder engagement and dialogue.\nTELUS is a global leader in the responsible and ethical use of AI, and recently won an international Outstanding Organization 2023 prize from the Responsible AI Institute in recognition of its commitment to fostering trust and benefitting society. Its also the first telecom company in Canada to sign the Government of Canadas voluntary code of conduct for generative AI, which aims to ensure the transparent, equitable and responsible development and deployment of GenAI technology. Earlier this year, the company published its inaugural TELUS AI report: The power of perspectives in Canada, sharing the perceptions, insights and opinions of AI from nearly 5,000 Canadians, including Indigenous Peoples, racialized groups, older Canadians, new Canadians, youth, people with physical disabilities, and the LGBTQ2S+ community.\nFor more information about TELUS commitment to responsible AI, visit telus.com/responsibleAI.\nAbout TELUS:\nTELUS (TSX: T, NYSE: TU) is a dynamic, world-leading communications technology company with more than $20 billion in annual revenue and over 19 million customer connections spanning wireless, data, IP, voice, television, entertainment, video, and security.

telecom achieves 15% success rate in cold calling\nThe goal\nTo create a new approach to telemarketing that increases sales, increases agent retention and aligns with newly introduced French regulations regarding the practice of cold calling.\nThe outcome\n0.5%\nagent attrition rate\nThe challenge\nBouygues Telecom is a leading French mobile network operator, internet service provider and IPTV company that, due to the hyper-competitive nature of its industry, relies on cold calling and direct marketing to grow its customer base. Direct marketing is a valuable source of revenue. Even if the initial success rate is low, once the brand has won a customers trust, it can upsell and cross-sell over the lifetime of that relationship. In the telecoms market, competition is so intense that every brand is constantly searching for an idea of innovation that can give it an edge over its rivals.\nDespite being viewed as old-fashioned and a form of selling that traditionally achieves a single-percentage success rate, cold callings persistence is due in part to the fact that its still a relatively cost-effective and simple-to-quantify means of marketing. So how do you improve the success rate and do so in a new regulatory environment that limits how and when an organization can call a person without their consent?\nThe solution\nSupport delivered from France to customers in the French market\nChannels\nChatbot, voice\nLanguage\nFrench\nWorking together with Bouygues and internet advertising data brokers, Foundever developed a new approach to cold calling, called Hot Leads. It earned its name because each phone number passed on to our outbound marketing teams has been filtered and qualified  in real time. This means that our agents are reaching out to someone who has expressed an interest in a product or service just minutes before. Not only does this reduce the length of time for a typical call, but it also markedly increases the possibility of sales success.\nHow it works\nWe develop and build a chatbot for internet data brokers.\nThe brokers work with Bouygues to develop interactive targeted ads and sponsored links on search engines and social media feeds.\nPotential customers interact with the chatbots integrated into the advertising.\nThe chatbots gather a greater level of insight, qualifying that a potential customer is interested in a product or service and wants to learn more.\nThese hot leads are passed to our teams who make contact.\nAnd, of course, this approach to generating and interacting with potential leads perfectly aligns with the letter of the law regarding Frances recently introduced telemarketing activities regulations.\nResults\n0.5%\nagent attrition rate\nSince hot leads have hit the French market, Bouygues has enjoyed a 15% success rate and the agents have been more engaged and happier in their roles as one in every six calls theyre making ends in a sale. \nThis is reflected in agent attrition and absenteeism rates that have been running at 0.5% and 1.8%, respectively, since the client adopted the hot leads approach. Over the past 12 months, that 15% success rate has translated into an average of 400 sales per agent and, crucially, they have achieved these results without tarnishing the clients brand reputation or perceptions of its CX capabilities. Our hot leads FTEs consistently average a 4.6 out of 5 CSAT score.\nWhen the French government outlined the full scope of Decree N2022-1313, many called the regulations the death of cold calling. However, the hot leads program has done more than simply resuscitate telemarketing, it has given it a second life and proven that theres an easier way to sell directly to existing and potential customers without damaging brand reputation, without damaging the employee experience and without leaving success to chance.", "source_url": "https://foundever.com/case-studies/bouygues-telecom-achieves-15-percent-success-rate-in-cold-calling/"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 28, "end": 31, "text": "15%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 105, "end": 108, "text": "15%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "0.5%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1490, "end": 1497, "text": "Chatbot", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1651, "end": 1660, "text": "Hot Leads", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1906, "end": 1918, "text": "just minutes", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2753, "end": 2757, "text": "0.5%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2846, "end": 2849, "text": "15%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3071, "end": 3075, "text": "0.5%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3080, "end": 3084, "text": "1.8%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3154, "end": 3172, "text": "the past 12 months", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3179, "end": 3182, "text": "15%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 204, "end": 209, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2042, "end": 2047, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3234, "end": 3239, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2491, "end": 2500, "text": "hot leads", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2785, "end": 2794, "text": "hot leads", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3129, "end": 3138, "text": "hot leads", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3391, "end": 3400, "text": "hot leads", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3596, "end": 3605, "text": "hot leads", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "FROM OVERWHELMED TO OPTIMIZED: HOW A MAJOR TELECOM REDUCED CUSTOMER WAIT TIMES BY 70% WITH GENAI-POWERED CHATBOTS\nAuthors\nMayank Choubey Ushur, USA Author \nKeywords: \nGenerative AI, Customer Service, Telecommunications, Chatbots, Digital Transformation \nAbstract\nThis case study examines how a leading telecommunications company revolutionized its customer service operations by implementing Generative AI (GenAI) powered chatbots.

As Californias largest utility company, PG&E provides natural gas and electricity to 5.2 million households in the northern two-thirds of California.\nChallenges\nCustomers being forced to engage with an outdated IVR system that was unable to meet their needs, leading call wait times of over an hour during due to unpredictable weather & natural events\nSolution\nAn enterprise generative deployment that meets strict regulations, authenticates customers to keep accounts secure, scales to meet demand during outages and handles customer queries in multiple languages\nResult\n35,000 labor hours have been saved by the PolyAI agent, increasing CSAT by 22% and achieving 67% containment, 6% higher than the legacy IVR\nChallenge\nPG&E received approximately 16 million calls a year but unpredictable weather events caused extreme peaks in volumes, with daily call numbers in the tens of thousands during these emergencies. These problems were compounded further by call center agent retention challenges and an outdated IVR solution, leaving customers frustrated and waiting over an hour to speak to someone.\nThe existing IVR was built by their CCaaS provider, who had automated common call flows like payments. However, managing the system proved difficult and costly. With over 7,000 utterances in the IVR, updates were time-consuming and expensive, limiting the teams ability to enhance the customer experience over the phone.\nAdditionally, PG&E was about to implement a rate increase that would create a substantial surge in call volumes, putting additional pressure on the existing system, and ultimately lengthening wait times even further. The team needed a solution that could hit the ground running, scale quickly to meet demand and satisfy strict industry regulation and safety requirements, all while providing a positive customer experience.\nSolution\nPG&E partnered with PolyAI to build an AI agent that could initially work in conjunction with their existing IVR. This approach, as well as starting without any API integrations, allowed the team to get a solution up and running quickly without rebuilding their existing contact center infrastructure. With this initial deployment success, integrations were built into key platforms like Oracle and Cisco, as well as numerous in-house systems. These integrations have allowed the scope of use cases handled by the PolyAI agent to increase dramatically.\nDistressed customers calling the dedicated outages line are immediately greeted and reassured by PolyAIs agent, Peggy, that the situation is under control and are provided with an outages update based on their location. Peggy has the ability to give information about the outage, including an estimate of when the issue will be resolved with accuracy and compassion.\nAdditionally, Peggy answers billing inquiries and FAQs in both English and Spanish, with the ability to text customers a link to specific online resources where they can self-serve without speaking to an agent, further reducing the volume of calls that go to the contact center.\nWith utilities being a highly regulated industry, it was essential that this solution met strict regulations and safety requirements. The AI agent handles millions of calls a year across highly sensitive topics, including potential gas leaks, where any wrong answer or error can have disastrous consequences. PolyAIs robust guardrails and proprietary tech stack ensure queries are answered correctly and customers are accurately routed when needed, enabling Peggy to be the first generative deployment in a regulated industry.\nPolyAI worked with PG&E to establish a positive ROI target of 3.5% call containment. PolyAIs agent surpassed that on the first day, successfully containing 15% of calls, and that overall containment figure has now reached 67%. This has resulted in 35,000 labor hours saved and, as new use cases are identified, this number will continue to go up. Customers have been surprised to have their calls answered immediately and have been thanking the AI agent for its help, which is reflected in a 22% increase in CSAT for outage calls despite this being a traditionally distressing call type. \nFurthermore, the ability of the PolyAI agent to understand and speak in complete sentences allowed it to achieve a 25% reduction in customer effort via more efficient calls compared to the previous conversational IVR solution. Additionally, PG&E previously had very little insight into its call data and call types due to mis-routing and unreliable after-call notes. PolyAI accurately records call data, giving the company a much clearer understanding of their customer needs and empowering them to make informed decisions for future automation. \nFuture plans\nHaving achieved significant success so far, the PG&E and PolyAI teams are continuing to build and expand the scope of the AI agent. Start/Stop service, appointment setting and expanded billing capabilities are just some use cases being built in the coming months, with each set to be available in English and Spanish satisfying PG&Es diverse customer base.\nWith these use cases in place and 100% of calls handled by the Poly AI agent, PG&E aim to sunset their legacy IVR by the end of the year.\nSee how PolyAI can transform your contact center like PG&E.

She said, when you start taking too many support tickets, hire an internal manager that has done this before, and then immediately think about going with the outsourced route. She was like, picking thats going to be difficult well deal with that when we get to that corner. So I was lucky I found a really talented customer support manager , her names Deanna. She came from Robin Hood, its a retail brokerage. So ultimately she had a lot of experience. And the first thing she said was, Hey, I worked with this great team called Concentrix, I even went to the Philippines a few times and worked with our agents and theyre awesome. I would love to reach out to them and figure out if they would even entertain taking us. And this is why I was like, I dont know, I think were too small. Like, these are big international firms, like, are we big enough? But ultimately, what it boiled down to was, we could have tried to cobble together some, you know, overseas agents, but there was too many regulatory hurdles for us to do this because we are our subsidiaries are really like a broker dealer, if remember, and a registered investment advisor overseen by the SEC. So we have all these rules and regulations and security requirements for user information that I just, we couldnt shortcut. We couldnt let just kind of like chance happen. So we over invested in finding an enterprise level partner early in our existence and made a strategic decision to do that. And yeah, support was what we needed. And we figured if you could do it for Robin and you could do it for us.\nYeah. We were hitting 1200, 1500 tickets a week. I just onboarded Deanna and we were just like, we need scalability and flexibility. So we thought, well, what if I, you know, got some intern to do this for 20 bucks an hour or 30 bucks an hour in New York, you know, they could sit next to me. But then, you know, think about this. You need to get a computer, you need to onboard them, you need to train them. Theres many, many steps in scaling a system like this and we were doing it, we were executing. And one thing that we thought was like, how do we outsource scalability itself? And thats what Concentrix was. Like you all have reps and experience and professional services that enable us to build really good systems that we just didnt have built, right? So, you know, I think you (Daniel Marini) and I we talked to like, probably need a QA person and you need a team leader. And I was like, well, I just need three agents. I can team lead equality assured. And youre like, no, thats not scalable. And sure enough, it wasnt scalable.

We delivered a comprehensive set of recommendations to help the Council transform sustainably, identifying up to 3.9 million in potential savings through innovative solutions that will also enhance the customer and employee experience.\nSBC is a local authority responsible for delivering public services to 115,000 residents. With approximately 4,900 employees, it provides a range of services, including education, social care, justice, housing, and waste management.\nLike many public sector organizations, SBC faces growing financial pressures. Within its Business Support Services and Customer Advice and Support Services teams specifically (totalling 321 full-time equivalent roles), SBC needs to reduce operating costs while driving greater efficiency, aiming to deliver the same services at 90% of the current budgetwithout compromising quality.\nTo enable this, the Council turned to our business strategy experts. CGI has a longstanding partnership with SBC, providing both strategic advisory services and managed support. For this engagement, SBC sought our help to gain practical transformation recommendations aligned with its strategic goals, along with support to build the required tools, knowledge, and confidence to deliver change across the organization.\nThe aim was to establish a sustainable, value-focused model for continuous improvement and value delivery that would positively impact both customers and employees.\nThe benefits\nOur work is helping SBC deliver meaningful outcomes across its financial, operational, and strategic priorities, including:\nUp to 3.9 million in potential savings identified over 5 years through 29 financial value propositions focused on cost-efficiencies and income generation.\n23 non-financial value propositions offering opportunities to enhance both customer and employee experiences.\nScope identification for immediate impact from a CGI-developed AI chatbot pilot, which would deliver early value with a clear roadmap for wider rollout.\nA comprehensive business case and embedded internal capability to support sustainable digital transformation, enabling improved service delivery and long-term fiscal savings.\nIdentifying and prioritizing transformation opportunities\nWe collaborated closely with SBCs teams to identify the best opportunities to reduce costs and drive efficiencies. Using CGIs proven value-driven digital strategy approach, we:\n1. Reviewed key documents to align with the organizational strategy \nTo build a comprehensive understanding, we reviewed a range of corporate documents, including financial statements, organizational strategic plans, and departmental service plans. This desk-based analysis allowed us to identify initial insights on business challenges, which we validated with stakeholders.\n2. Analyzed financial data to shape high-impact focus areas \nWe conducted financial analysis at organizational, directorate, and departmental levels to highlight areas of major spend. This enabled us to generate initial value hypotheses based on high-value areas, which guided the scope and direction of our analysis.\n3. Engaged stakeholders to understand their goals and challenges \nWe engaged a broad group of management and operational stakeholders across both departments. Through structured interviews, we explored objectives, pain points, and opportunities across people, processes, and technology dimensions.\n4. Defined SBCs strategic imperatives \nThis insight enabled us to define a set of strategic imperatives aligned with SBCs wider organizational goals. These imperatives were validated with the business and formed the foundation for a series of value propositions, encompassing both financial and non-financial outcomes.\n5. Quantified value and shaped solution options \nTo quantify the potential impact, we re-engaged stakeholders to gather and validate operational data. This allowed us to conduct credible value calculations. At the same time, we applied technical expertise to shape solution options that aligned with SBCs existing technical landscape and supported its business capabilities.\n6. Built a business case for transformation \nEach solution was then priced and assessed for return on investment (ROI), culminating in a clear and compelling business case. Our recommended solutions supported strategic alignment across both departments, balancing fiscal pressures with ambitions for service improvement and digital transformation.\nRecommending digital solutions to deliver tangible strategic outcomes\nOur work centered around three strategic pillars, each targeting a key area of transformation across SBCs Business Support Services and Customer Advice and Support Services teams.\n1. Digital channels\n2. Automation\n3. Customer insights\nEmpowering digital customers\nSBC handles more than 180,000 customer queries annually across 6 channels: live chat, phone, email, the corporate website, webforms, and in-person contact. Despite this high volume, digital enablement across these channels remained limited, resulting in inefficiencies and a heavy reliance on manual customer engagement and resolution management.\nTo address this, we recommended the adoption of AI-driven customer interaction tools across three of SBCs channels as a starting pointlive chat, phone, and emailto enhance self-service capabilities through an AI chatbot, digital agent, and email handling.\nThese solutions aim to reduce manual workloads, enable faster and more scalable service delivery, and lower operational costs by:\nAutomating high-volume, repetitive tasks\nReducing reliance on manual query resolution\nImproving service consistency and speed\nEnabling data-driven insights through trend analysis and machine learning\nProviding proof of value to expand AI across remaining channels and the wider business \n2. Optimizing operations through automation\nOur analysis revealed a high volume of manual, inefficient, and siloed processes across both departments driven by fragmented technologies, limited digital maturity, and de-centralized budgets. To address this, we recommended the standardization and automation of internal workflows to improve operational efficiency, accuracy, and the employee experience.\nWe identified a set of high-value, quick-realization use cases where automation could deliver immediate benefits such as time savings, reduced error rates, and improved customer service. These were supported by recommendations for technical integrations that would enable scalable, long-term improvements.\nBy targeting critical processes from the outset, our strategy ensures that SBC can unlock early value, build internal momentum, and increase employee confidence in transformation efforts. This buy-in will also contribute to greater engagement with future change as the organization continues to evolve.\nGetting to know customers\nWe found that SBCs customer data was fragmented across multiple systems, with limited integration and inconsistent data quality. This lack of data mastery and accessibility was inhibiting effective decision-making, the customer experience, and revenue recovery.\nWe therefore recommended that SBC enhance its data management and customer insight capabilities to create a single, unified customer view. By improving systems integration and maturing data governance, the Council can transition to a more data-driven, digitally-enabled model, enhancing outcomes across both departments.\nA key focus is debt recovery as a means of increasing income generation. SBC holds significant arrears in council tax and non-domestic ratescompounded by manual processes and disconnected dataso we proposed the implementation of simple, cost-effective technology to:\nEnable proactive debt recovery\nImprove data accuracy and accessibility\nIncrease in-year collection rates\nReduce long-term arrears accumulation.\nOur analysis projects that this solution could help increase SBCs in-year collections from 96.6% to 98.8%, and non-domestic rates from 97.2% to 98.8%, delivering up to 2.5 million in annual revenue. This would not only improve cash flow, but enable cost optimization in a sustainable, non-disruptive way, reducing reliance on service cuts or workforce reduction to meet budget demands.\nData-driven approach to sustainable transformation, aligned with strategic imperatives and user experiences\nOpportunities for operational and cost efficiencies, with up to 3.9 million in potential savings identified\nBuilding the internal capability to successfully deliver transformation\nFrom the outset of the engagement, we worked closely with SBC to ensure that, as we developed and delivered the digital strategy, we also supported its teams to learn and apply it. We designed and delivered a tailored training program for a cohort of employees. The curriculum aligned to our delivery plan and the value-driven digital strategy, and combined theoretical learning with practical application, working through real-life scenarios using fictional case studies, collaborative workshops, and structured support.\nThis embedded learning journey helped strengthen our longstanding relationship with SBC, and as a trusted partner, we continue to support and enable its transformation goals. SBC is now equipped with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to apply its new digital strategy to address financial constraints, creating a sustainable model for continuous improvement and value delivery across the whole organization.\nThis internal capability will support a more agile, data-driven approach to transformation, helping the Council deliver its strategic imperatives and achieve operational and cost-efficiencies with up to 3.9 million in potential savings.\nLearn how\nCGIs Value-Driven Digital Strategy Framework\nbridges the gap between strategic intent and business impact.", "source_url": "https://www.cgi.com/en/case-study/business-consulting/unlocking-transformation-opportunities-for-scottish-borders-council-through-value-driven-digital-strategy"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 440, "end": 458, "text": "up to 3.9 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1131, "end": 1134, "text": "90%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1914, "end": 1926, "text": "3.9 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1959, "end": 1971, "text": "over 5 years", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 5073, "end": 5081, "text": "insights", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 5158, "end": 5166, "text": "annually", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 7619, "end": 7634, "text": "data governance", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8237, "end": 8242, "text": "-year", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8260, "end": 8265, "text": "96.6%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8269, "end": 8274, "text": "98.8%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8304, "end": 8309, "text": "97.2%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8313, "end": 8318, "text": "98.8%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8331, "end": 8349, "text": "up to 2.5 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8353, "end": 8359, "text": "annual", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8722, "end": 8740, "text": "up to 3.9 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 9975, "end": 9993, "text": "up to 3.9 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 10016, "end": 10021, "text": "Learn", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 757, "end": 761, "text": "care", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 8243, "end": 8254, "text": "collections", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 5633, "end": 5645, "text": "self-service", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1610, "end": 1613, "text": "aim", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 5733, "end": 5736, "text": "aim", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3044, "end": 3052, "text": "insights", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 5994, "end": 6002, "text": "insights", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "An innovative approach to teacher recruitment\nEnsuring excellent teachers for every child is central to the Department for Educations (DfE) mission of helping everyone realize their potential.

Consumers were shifting consumption from beer to wine, spirits and craft beersor moving away from alcoholic beverages altogether. Traditional brewers were left to compete in a market that was growing steadily smaller. And they had to spend more to do so.\nTo break away from the pack, Carlsberg needed to take drastic action. Their CEO spearheaded an ambitious seven-year strategic plan, dubbed Sail 22, which had two main goals. The first was to cut operational costs by one-third to increase working capital and shareholder dividends. The second was to invest those savings in future growth.\nIts leaders knew the companys future rested on its ability to transform into a digital business, and they were confident that a move to the cloud was a necessary step in their transformation.\nWhen tech meets human ingenuity\nSince Accenture brought deep cloud expertise and was already working with the brewer to optimize its SAP applications, the two joined forces to map out Carlsbergs transformation to the cloud.\nThe ultimate goal was to create a nimble, simplified digital business characterized by intelligent operations: data, applied intelligence and human ingenuity combined to drive better decisions, customer experiences and outcomes.\nMoving to the cloud was the critical first step to carrying out its digital transformations and achieving its goal of intelligent operations. But the brewery group was not planning a typical cloud migration; it wanted to transition 100% of its global process workloadspreviously managed with legacy systems and an on-premise data centerto a cloud environment. The solution would represent one of the largest and most complex transitions ever undertaken in the food and beverage industry. Given the scope of change at play, there was not a moment to waste.\nTransforming to a digital business with cloud\nIn just eight weeks, a team comprising Carlsberg and Accenture Technology professionals developed a one-of-a-kind cloud strategy and selected Microsoft Azure as the cloud platform of choice. As Haywood pointed out, Accentures agnostic approach was just what was needed.\nTapping the robust ecosystem of Accenture alliance partners, Avanade and Microsoft, Carlsberg built its Azure architecture in just 10 weeks, embedding automation and innovation wherever possible to create better service quality and user experiences. In just six months, Carlsberg migrated 1,300 servers and 650 critical business applications to the cloud. The global migration occurred in three wavesthe last of which involved moving 40 terabytes of dataand was completed with no disruption to the business.\nUltimately, Carlsberg zeroed in on transformations designed to enhance customer experiences, improve agility in local markets and gain greater customer insights.\nThey included:\nAn application transformation focused on reducing technology costs and optimizing the application landscape. Carlsberg became one of the first companies in Europe to close its datacenter.\nA connected bar solution introduced a new, sustainable, lighter-weight beer keg with IoT sensors to gauge real-time consumption and link directly with marketing campaignsa first for the company.\nA smart brewery solution uses IoT sensors to identify problems during the production process and automatically issue maintenance requests minimizing service disruptions and optimizing production.\nA service delivery transformation includes a new service desk, standardizing processes, applying intelligent tools and automation, and optimizing team configurations.\nA valuable difference\nToday, Carlsberg has the scalable, flexible cloud infrastructure and the simplified, automated application landscape needed to support its transition to a digital business. It has also shifted 100% of its systems and applications from a legacy to cloud environment. Major system incidents have already dropped from an average of 13 per month to just five. Better reliability, security and disaster recovery capabilities are just the beginning. With the clouds variable cost model, Carlsberg has been able to significantly reduce operating expenditures and achieve the benefits of the business case.\n100% in the cloud = unlimited innovation\nAnother key advantage is the freedom to innovate and experiment. Carlsberg now has the ability to operate much more quickly. It is launching new initiatives and campaigns in hours, rather than months.\nThe ability to develop IT solutions quickly, with certainty, is allowing Carlsberg to deliver more satisfying user and customer experiences. In short, the move to the cloud has freed up savings and laid the foundation for growth.\nAnd the best is yet to come: With its new cloud platform and an optimized application landscape, the company will continually look for ways to use its new computing environment to achieve greater efficiencies and grow its brand in new markets. Accenture, which recently renewed its strategic partnership with Carlsberg through 2025, will be with the brewer every step of the waycapturing the full potential of SAP, squeezing more value from the cloud, and creating innovative services and solutions that set Carlsberg apart as a leader in the digital world.", "source_url":

Golden Nugget has six locations in Nevada, Louisiana, New Jersey, Illinois, and Mississippi.\nChallenge\nGolden Nugget Hotels & Casinos were experiencing increased call volume, reduced staff, and the new task of handling PBX calls.\nSolution\nA hotel voice assistant that can take complex hotel room reservations over the phone through natural conversations.\nResults\nThe voice assistant took 3,000 reservations for one hotel in just 1 month = $600,000 in revenue.\nChallenge\nIncreased call volume and reduced staff led Golden Nugget to invest in pioneering call center voice AI to assist the team with handling calls to the hotel PBX operators.\nGolden Nugget was looking for a complete solution to meet the overwhelming reservations demand coming through on the phone. Without the staff to handle the influx, they needed a way to automate the call booking process without compromising on the guest experience.\nWith 87% of these calls fully automated, Golden Nugget was confident that the assistant could handle their most complex call type  reservations.\nAlthough online booking is available, 70% of Golden Nugget hotel room reservations are made over the phone. Each reservation takes around 4-5 minutes and requires:\nLoyalty member or guest details\nRoom type\nDates\nNumber of people\nDeposit\nSolution\nPolyAI worked with Golden Nugget to empower the voice assistant to take room reservations over the phone through natural and free-flowing conversations.\nWhile the call center voice AI was not designed to replace their call center or PBX teams entirely, it significantly reduced the volume of reps needed and wait time for guests and allowed those employees to give their full attention to more complex reservations or other operational needs while the voice assistant answered questions about when the pool opens, restaurant hours and so on.\nReservation calls are complex with broad variability, with 15 different room types available, different levels of loyalty club membership, and availability. The voice assistant guides customers through the booking process in a way that feels natural and friendly but still follows business logic.\n34% \nall calls fully handled by the voice assistant\n87% \nnon-reservation calls handled by the voice assistant\n100% \ncalls answered, 24/7/365\nThe voice assistant currently handles 34% of all calls to the Golden Nugget central reservations line. This is the equivalent of 3 days of agent time per week. Within just two months of launch, the voice assistant already averages over 300 completed reservations per week, which includes taking secure payment details over the phone. PolyAIs team of dialogue scientists, linguists and software engineers continue to work with Golden Nugget to execute on a roadmap of continuous improvement initiatives. These include features such as negotiating dates with a caller depending on a combination room availability and personalized offers, or incorporating offer codes from email marketing campaigns. \nIts a great experience.

As this transformation unfolds, business leadersaccording to recent Accenture researchcite workforce upskilling as their most pressing challenge.\nHP Inc. (HP) has taken a proactive step with the launch of HP University (HPU), where HPs sales teams and channel partners develop critical skills to grow and thrive. HPU offers a blended learning curriculum that develops critical selling skills and deep product knowledge. A hub of sales, products, services and certification knowledge for more than 5,000 HP sales representatives and 50,000 channel partners, it continuously ties learning to performance.\nUsing data-driven insights for customized role-based learning paths, it is helping HP's sales approach transition from transactional sales to a solution and outcome-based selling.

For example, an entry-level sales representative might begin with courses on negotiation, storytelling, and product knowledge. As they advance, they take on more complex subjects, such as relationship-building and handling high-stakes sales scenarios with C-level executives. The training modules, crafted with HP-specific examples and high-tech industry scenarios, make learning relevant and directly applicable to daily tasks and challenges.\nThe goal is to pivot to contractual-led sales conversations, build long-term, meaningful client relationships and turn every sale into a strategic advisory opportunity.\nLearning unleashed\nA 360-degree annual assessment of the sales teams maps year-over-year competency improvement, resulting in a 7% increase in quota attainment, suggesting that better training leads to higher revenue.\nIn HPs fiscal 2024, 97% of sales

drives effective patient management. To date, the solution has achieved:\nReinventing the approach to patient care\nCCS, a leading chronic care management company providing clinical solutions and home-delivered medical supplies for those living with chronic conditionsparticularly diabeteshad retained their proprietary customer data for over 30 years. Now, they sought a solution that would make their data actionable while addressing a core commitment: reinforcing holistic health and the prevention of co-morbidities so often seen in diabetes patients. Just as importantly, the solution would be a core resource in their journey to reinvent from a medical equipment supplier to a proactive chronic care management organization.\nTo transform their approach to patient care as well as their personalized outreach strategy, CCS joined forces with Accenture to develop a Customer Analytics Record (CAR), essential for providing insights into customer needs and preferences, and an AI-powered predictive model using advanced analytics. This advanced analytics program, PropheSee, has been a successhelping to improve adherence among targeted, high-risk patient cohorts by as much as 50%.\nThe gateway to a world of data and insights\nThe CCS and Accenture team started by analyzing over two decades of the companys proprietary data. The team combined CCSs internal data and social determinants of health information, effectively integrating them to create a longitudinal view of patients and ultimately building the CAR.\nThe team then created and evaluated multiple predictive models, with the 'winning model achieving an impressive 85% accuracy in predicting patient behavior almost three months in advance1 and integrating seamlessly into CCSs existing Azure Data Lake environment.\nPropheSee has proven its value by enabling specific customer outreach programs, using CAR data to generate intervention messages that encourage patients to stay on track with their treatment plans. The solution can not only enhance patient engagement but is expected to take patients preferred communication methods into account in the future including when, what and how they want to be contacted.\nFrom actionable data to healthier patients\nCCS has realized a solution providing a holistic view of each patient and facilitating more informed decision-making and effective patient management, ultimately helping retain customers and drive adherence to essential treatments.\nWith its ability to track patient behavior, link the impact of patient characteristics to adherence and predict compliance with treatments, weeks in advance, PropheSee delivers intervention programs which keep patients on track, and reduce overall costs. In addition to improved clinical outcomes, health plans and risk-bearing providers can also realize savings of up to US$2,200 per patient per year from an increase in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) adherence and better glycemic control as well as waste avoidance in CGM setup costs.\nCCS has made strides in understanding customer needs, enhancing patient care, and proactively identifying and engaging high-risk individuals before adherence issues escalate.

We have worked with NATOs Allied Command Transformation (ACT) to develop and implement its first AI-supported modular knowledge agent within the scope of a lighthouse project with the BI-SC NATO SECRET (NS) security classification level. The solution works without an Internet connection, significantly speeds up the involved processes and delivers highly precise results.\nNATOs first widely used AI tool: AI FELIX\nACT, based in Norfolk, Virginia in the United States, is one of NATOs two strategic military commands. It is responsible for driving the alliances future development. Every day, hundreds of incoming documents need to be analyzed, compiled, classified, edited and used. AI FELIX, a digital knowledge agent, was created to significantly accelerate these processes while also greatly improving access to data and achieving information superiority. Within the scope of an internal project that began in 2019, ACT created the first prototype and minimum viable product (MVP). The result was a very successful example of ACTs vision to introduce AI-based process automation.\nIn 2023, from that base, ACT and we then launched a joint effort to refine, scale and integrate the MVP into a fully fledged industrialized enterprise AI service. By combining ACTs vision with lessons learned and our expertise in developing and rolling out enterprise applications on a large scale, we succeeded in rapidly implementing the first module  the Command Read Board (CRB)  across 27 locations by the fall of 2024. Our intimate familiarity with NATOs processes was also crucial for the success of this project.\nACT needed two additional modules to be introduced by the end of 2024: Task Portfolio Management (TPM) and a customized AI-enabled digital assistant (FELIX).\nAI FELIX at a glance\nProvision of NATOs first broadly used AI capability\nNS security level: without Internet connection, completely implemented on-premises\nImplemented so far at 27 locations of the NATO command structure\nScalable for up to 30,000 users\nProcessing time per document reduced from 5  10 minutes to 27 seconds\nUse of state-of-the-art technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics\n27 seconds\nprocessing time per document reduced from 510 minutes\n27 locations\nof the NATO command structure have implemented the solution\nCommand Read Board (CRB): the central information processing platform\nOne of the biggest challenges faced while developing and implementing this AI-supported tool was creating the protected environment, separate from the Internet, in which the CRB executes.\nAfter receiving the first prototypes from NATO, we trained, fine-tuned and developed them further on tens of thousands of documents that had been generated specifically for this purpose. The algorithms involved were also tweaked to optimize their functionality.\nToday the CRB is able to analyze incoming documents, emails and other messages, generate summaries, classify correspondence according to its confidentiality level and extract metadata from it, identify and define tasks, prioritize information and much more.\nCRB does not operate in isolation; instead, it is fully integrated in NATOs suite of information management tools, which include electronic document management system (EDMS) and task trackers. It is also straightforward to adapt to other environments in NATOs member countries, for example Germanys DokMBw.\nComing next: TPM for task portfolio management and FELIX for providing customized information\nThe modules of AI FELIX are interlinked. CRB identifies and generates tasks based on incoming documents, among other things. TPM helps keep track of these tasks, quickly identifies potential risks and generates tailored reports on these activities. Specifically, it monitors and controls tasks and makes predictions with AI support.\nThe third module, FELIX, flexibly provides users with information that is aligned with their particular responsibilities, needs and interests. FELIX can refer a user to certain documents or training courses or else suggest that they get in touch with other users. It also includes a light version of CRB that calls their attention to specifically relevant documents, automatically summarizes content or generates metadata.\nAI at NATO: a strategy with a future\nNATO ACT is convinced that the challenges the alliance is facing can only be mastered via an ongoing process of innovation. Especially for digitalization, it therefore makes a great deal of sense to use an artificial intelligence such as AI FELIX that can be quickly implemented, also in closed networks.\nAI FELIX began as a pilot effort and proof of concept but is now achieving maturity. While taking an agile approach, we will continue to steadily refine it in close coordination with users and develop and implement more new tools to facilitate everyday work and improve the quality of data.\nAdditionally, to achieve a scalable AI FELIX solution across 27 NATO locations, the solution is built on CGI AIOps Director, a platform for scalably deploying AI services and cloud

Their accountant clients are benefiting as well, not only with their new access to insightful industry information via Accountant Connect but also through the value-added, tailored touch points they receive from their ADP account manager.\nVertical IQs Industry Intelligence is our go-to as we build training curriculum because we want our associates to be able to go out to the market with prescribed tools and resources that they can leverage in their conversations to help gain access and then effectively run meetings, explained Sperduto.\nWhen were determining how to roll out a specific topic internally to our associates, Vertical IQ is our first stop as well because we want to have a finger on the pulse of whats going on in the market, she continued. Their benchmarks, trends, and statistics help validate and confirm whats happening within an industry, so that becomes a crucial starting place.\nADP also is using content from Vertical IQ for value-added prospect and client touchpoints. Were always looking for a snackable one- or two-pager to take into a firm, Gesing observed. Our associates like the fact that they can print a relevant chapter of the Industry Profile or pull an industry-focused news article from Vertical IQ that applies to a client or prospects industry, and they can leverage that to gain access. They send that kind of thought leadership or news about whats happening in that particular industry to their COI or their CPA partner, and theyre then able to have an intelligent conversation based on that one article.\nGesing continued: Our CPA firms tell us they appreciate the continuing education coming from us  whether it be on a product, a solution, something happening in the marketplace, a challenge  any of our thought leadership, and Vertical IQ definitely brings us this type of valuable industry expertise.\nWe hear a lot from accounting firms, and even brokers in the small business marketplace, who really like these insights, said Gesing. Their eyes lit up when I showed them the Industry Profile and what it looked like  especially the Call Prep Questions. They really liked this type of Industry Intelligence for their newer associates since they dont have the experience or industry expertise that a more tenured accountant or broker would have.\nThe real value of utilizing Vertical IQ is that it allows us at ADP to be an advisor to our CPA firms that are then advising their own clients, Gesing continued. Were able to bring them an Industry Intelligence solution that makes it super-easy for them to do their job and for them to brush up on or go a little bit deeper into an industry that they may not be as familiar with. Its trusted research thats quick, easy, and convenient for them to have at their fingertips. Knowing that this outstanding resource is coming from us at ADP  it just elevates the partnership, and its an additional value-add that we offer to them.\nBut the advantages dont end there, Gesing observed. Those CPAs also will extend this Industry Intelligence to their own clients, so its almost like a free deliverable that theyre able to provide to their clients as well, which is a huge value-add. Vertical IQ is a differentiator, allowing us to separate ourselves from our competition  to be that advisor who advises the advisor, which is the accountant. So, it helps them be the hero.\nMembers of ADPs leadership are even finding value in their access to Vertical IQs Industry Intelligence. Personally, I use it in my daily activities, Sperduto noted.

By adding smart tools to this data layer, we are helping the company use AI for better planning and forecasting, aiming to boost productivity and generating over half a billion dollars in value to self-fund the reinvention. For example, the food manufacturing giant is using gen AI to predict inventory risks, such as product damage, and suggest solutions, already saving millions yearly. Plus, we created an AI-based platform that helps supervisors and workers communicate clearly, cutting down errors caused by language barriers.\nFood manufacturing is central to the companys supply chain, so we developed a comprehensive manufacturing vision and practical playbook.

Fee management was especially ready for improvement. Many customers received five or more invoices  a hassle for the customers and expensive for the bank.\nFinding a customer experience innovator\nThe bank looked for a way to put customers at the center of the invoicing process. Traditional banking software offered a path that added new layers of complexity. There had to be a better option.\nLeaders at the bank explored how other highly regulated industries overcame complexity to take a customer-centric view. Amdocs came up again and again in their research. The bank decided to work with Amdocs to transform fee management into a customer-centric process. \nA customer-centric view \nThe Amdocs team planned and deployed an approach that let the bank organize billing by customer. The bank shifted from multiple invoices per customer to one. This delivered an immediate customer experience boost. Customers received one invoice for multiple accounts and services. \nHigher revenue with bundling\nThe bank saw another win: product innovation agility. It began to introduce new products and modify existing ones 200% faster. This opened the door to new products, personalization, and bundling. \nProduct innovation is delighting customers. For instance, commercial banking customers receive their first six transactions of the month with no fees. This saves them money. And it encourages larger transactions early in the month  an efficiency gain for the bank.\nAutomated quality assurance \nThe Amdocs team delivered an end-to-end quality assurance process, too.

As the #1 telecom brand in France and the #8 brand worldwide, maintaining high customer service availability while meeting the demands of a growing customer base is vital.\nThe goal for Orange was twofold: to decrease the number of technical support contacts handled via phone and eChat while improving the overall customer experience. To achieve this, Orange set out to create an interactive, self-service resource capable of first-line technical troubleshooting and answering questions about customer accounts.\nThe Solution\nOrange France developed Djingo: a contextual AI assistant that can assist customers with internet, phone, and TV troubleshooting--quickly and in a personalized way.\nDjingo interacts with customers much like a human chat agent, through a text-based conversational interface available on Oranges website, Skype, or Facebook Messenger. Djingo can look up account information, answer questions about billing, and help customers diagnose internet or phone connectivity issues.\nDjingo does all of this on top of a 100% open source stack, including Rasa for NLU and dialogue management. Orange chose Rasa for its flexibility, its ability to execute on premise, and its fully machine learning-based approach. With every conversation users have with Djingo, the assistant learns and improves, providing greater accuracy over time.\nThe Results\nSince deploying Djingo, Orange has reduced the number of support contacts handled by human agents, reducing costs and optimizing agent workloads by automating responses to the most common issues.\nAnd most importantly, customer satisfaction is on the rise, with the ability to resolve issues when they happen, day or night.\nWe developed a real partnership with Rasa based on 3 axes: developing skills rapidly, correcting bugs quickly, and sharing a wish list with the dev team.

{"text": "Why 83% of Legal & General clients getting help via AI prefer it \nKey challenges\nLegal & General Insurance (L&G)* wanted to explore using AI to help manage an overwhelming number of customer enquiries. This turned into an urgent need for a near-overnight solution when covid hit and contact volumes skyrocketed. To succeed, there were critical measures the insurer would need to put in place:\nTo answer specific queries the AI assistant needs access to policy details\nAny information given out has to be pre-approved by a legal team\nAny personal data coming in must be fully secured and protected\nKey results\nL&G booked a call with us to find out how launching an AI assistant could help. They quickly understood AI-driven conversations can be natural in tone but complex in nature, just like the ones their agents were having every day over the phone.\nTheir SmartHelp AI assistant was trained to solve 95% of queries\nThey have complete control over the content of any response it sends out\nSupport teams are under less stress with routine enquiries now handled by AI\n(*part of LV= General Insurance Group)\nNotable breakthroughs along the way\nSmartHelp has enabled L&G to extend AI-driven services beyond general insurance\nAI helps L&G uncover patterns in customer behaviour that transforms their insight\nThe customer service teams benefit just as much as customers do from the use of AI\nCustomers are happier speaking with SmartHelp than calling or emailing in\nBefore launching SmartHelp, L&G already knew the questions customers asked them most often, repeatedly. They also knew that even after investing significant time and energy in their customer journey, it was taking customers up to eight minutes to find information they needed on their website. What they didnt know is customers would come to prefer our advanced AI assistant over traditional methods of contact, since it learns on the job in real time what customers need most.\nL&G chose the name for their AI assistant and have full control over every response SmartHelp sends out to their valuable customers, which can be edited any time.\nAll they need to check SmartHelps progress is on their client dashboard:\n(Data shown is for illustrative purposes only) \nSeamlessly link up with insurance policy systems\nSmartHelp has to know the details of a persons policy to answer more complex questions about their terms of insurance. For this, L&G can rely on our 20+ years of experience with linking technology together to connect their AI assistant with their insurance policy systems.\nNow, customers can use SmartHelp to do everyday things like:\nCheck the details of their policy\nRenew a policy\nMake a claim\nCancel their insurance\nUpgrade to a new policy\nAnswers to queries are instant and the AI assistant doesnt need any input from the customer care team to perform these tasks.\nMake security checks every time a customer uses AI\nL&G customers are used to being asked security questions when they ring in  its reassurance their personal details are held safe with the insurer, and the same rule applies when they use the AI assistant.\nSmartHelp always makes a security check before connecting to the L&G policy system. Any personal information given is removed from the chat content before it reaches L&G, so customer data is fully protected.\nA human in the loop keeps AI in check\nHaving SmartHelp communicate with the L&G policy system is a complex technical challenge. Not only how it functions, but how it sounds too. Because customers will type St instead of Street, or say Tom instead of Thomas. We have to find an exact match to pass the security test, but we also have to account for the nuance of natural conversation. Thats why our team includes psychologists and language specialists who know how to configure content for an artificial brain and vice versa. A vital human in the loop, our experts understand how the human brain works so we can put in place the most useable yet robust safety measures.\nBackground security checks and regulatory compliance\nTo maintain enterprise-grade security throughout our platform, regulators check all of the content L&G passes onto customers using SmartHelp. L&G then checks the security processes we have in place by testing our technology systems, and these kinds of checks are regularly repeated, so SmartHelp is permanently ready to defend customer data.\nL&G approves and can instantly edit everything SmartHelp says to customers\nLike every customer, L&G wants AI assistant content to be accurate and in line with their brand personality. Not only this, they want customers to always get the same response, no matter whos asking a question (or how) about the same topic. Thats why, on our platform, you can use AI to generate a list of flows (sets of questions and answers) or you can write your own, but you can always edit the content of the flow, unpublish it, or delete it in an instant with the click of a button.\nConversation review is key to SmartHelp's success\nL&G can see which topics of conversation SmartHelp is dealing with most often whenever they want to from the client dashboard. Its easy for them to add new flows to make SmartHelp a little smarter than it was the month before, and because the AI assistant is speaking with L&G customers all the time, AI-driven conversations can sometimes be the first inkling somethings wrong. Say theres a problem with a web page not working or someone hasnt been able to get a payment through. With SmartHelp talking to people 24/7 in real time, L&G can act on this straight away, as soon as they hear theres an issue.\nL&G can quickly see where it needs to allocate resources\nWhen L&G saw how much SmartHelp was helping to relieve the pressure on their teams, they expanded AI support beyond general insurance to help with pet and home insurance too.\nThey saw a sudden, sharp rise in the number of people interested in pet insurance during covid lockdowns and were able to instantly start helping all the people who got a new pet as they started to spend more time at home.\nSmartHelp is always in season\nSometimes, a question about insurance has nothing to do with the individual and everything to do with the season. SmartHelp shows L&G Insurance exactly when in winter people start asking about cover for damp and when summer holiday cover takes priority.\nUp-to-the-minute AI assistance\nWhen customers started to ask more questions about insurance for garden offices, L&G recognised this as a result of more people working from home and immediately updated SmartHelp to give them answers.\nOver time, trends emerge from the AI assistants data, which gives L&G a better understanding of their business. They can now see which days or times are most busy, with which enquiries, and plan their resources accordingly.\nAI gets everybody talking and it's good for business\nWith an expertly trained AI assistant, rigid security checks to protect their customers, and our expert team helping them peer into every nook and cranny of their customer support services, L&G has significantly reduced the pressure their contact teams were feeling.\nTheyve been able to rely on SmartHelp to improve other areas of their business too, so they can help more customers in more ways, no matter what life throws at them along the way.\nWhen L&G better understands customer behaviour, they can  and do, make changes to their products or processes to act on customer feedback. Everything they learn from AI-powered conversations helps the insurer see in clear terms what they can do next to stay top of their game.\nLaunch an AI assistant today (or ask us to do it)\nIts easy to use our AI Studio to create and manage your own AI assistant, or you can choose our managed service and ask us to do it all for you. AI assistants are now used across all sorts of industries to transform customer service, and every organisation is different.\nImprove your business operations today\nGet an AI assistant working

But it doesnt have to be. In this blog, Foundever dives into how to look at collecting a customers payment as an opportunity for an outstanding CX.\nPublished September 29, 2025\nReading time4 min\nLets be real, collections and customer experience dont always mix well. It can be a delicate tightrope to walk, navigating one of the most emotionally charged points in a customers journey while also doing whats right for your business. For many customers, the collections call is a defining experience that determines whether they trust your brand moving forward or walk away for good.\nThe global debt collection services market was valued at $31.8 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% to 3.0% from 2025-2033. As debt grows, so does tension and distrust between consumers and companies. But how you handle collections can be a competitive advantage, and it takes more than a script and a dialer to get it right.\nWinning in collections means showing up with empathy, intelligence and the right tools every time. Here are five ways to lead those tough conversations and come out with trust intact.\n1. Build emotional readiness, not just process knowledge\nCollections customer experience teams need more than procedures and policies. They need the emotional resilience and empathy to navigate charged conversations. That starts with training that focuses on human connection  from handling objections with sensitivity to reading a customers tone and adjusting in real time.\nThis isnt only important in collections, but in general. As a new generation reshapes the consumer market, they look for brands that are empathetic and purpose-driven, and your employees need to train for this. Smart coaching, simulations and real-world role-playing help agents build the soft skills that truly move the needle.\n2. Dont just hear, actually tune in\nSurface-level listening wont cut it when someones under financial strain. Winning agents pick up on more than words. They respond to mood, hesitations and subtle cues. By creating space for customers to speak candidly and without judgment, agents open the door to solutions grounded in mutual respect, not pressure.\n3. Make digital options feel empowering\nWhen customers can manage their accounts on their own terms and on their own time, theyre far more likely to act. But that means your self-service tools need to be intuitive, fast and reassuring. In other words, make it as easy as possible for customers to handle their payments themselves. Think beyond having a portal.\nDesign a digital experience that gives people clarity, autonomy and peace of mind. The shift is already happening: 88% of U.S. debt collection companies offered a self-service portal in 2024, up from 79% the year prior.\n4. Let insight shape the interaction\nStart smarter by using behavioral data, customer history and analytics to inform every contact. When agents go in with a clearer picture  not just a balance due  they can tailor their approach, reduce friction and increase success. Data doesnt replace empathy, it sharpens it.\nCase in point: A leading motorcycle brand partnered with Foundever to transform its collections strategy using interaction analytics. The goal was to improve promise to pay (PTP) rates and boost overall collections outcomes. Through deep-dive analysis, Foundever identified a powerful opportunity to improve outcomes  in 75% of qualifying interactions, agents had the chance to suggest automatic payments, unlocking a clear path to boost results.\nBy implementing real-time alerts and agent guidance based on customer signals, the brand saw a 6% increase in PTPs and a 30% increase in collections in just six months. Its a powerful example of how data doesnt replace empathy but rather enhances it.\n5. Keep the door open after payment\nToo many brands treat collections as a final chapter. But customers remember how you showed up when it mattered most. Following up with care, even after a balance is settled, helps rebuild trust and lays the groundwork for loyalty. A thank-you message, a check-in or a quick survey can go a long way toward turning resolution into retention.\nIn fact, measuring CX through follow-up surveys can be invaluable data to show details about your interaction. Encore Capital Group, for example, reported that 92.5% of consumers in a survey rated their customer experience positively after engaging with a respectful, well-trained account manager.\nCollections is a relationship, not a transaction\nThe most successful collection conversations arent just about dollars recovered. Theyre about trust earned, relationships preserved and brand reputation protected. With the right combination of training, tools, empathy and insight, collections can evolve from a back-office necessity to a strategic CX advantage. \nWant more insight?

Current mass-market solutions are limited to basic, FAQ-based bots that are unable to handle complex requests and have no connection to back-end systems. Given ERGOs award-winning chat agents and concerns about data security, none of these solutions worked for them.\nThe Solution\nERGO deployed Rasa Open Source and Rasa Enterprise, laying the framework to automate over 30% of customer requests before continuing to full automation. The ERGO team identified which skills to prioritize through an extensive analysis of thousands of real customer service conversations. A 12-week training phase with agents further improved the accuracy of the system. The AI immediately suggests suitable answers, dramatically reducing response time and boosting productivity and resource availability.\nThe Results\nThe deployment convinced top management to invest in making the AI assistant fully autonomous for selected use cases. In addition, the company wants to deeply integrate the assistant into their live chat system.\nWith Rasa, we at ERGO are completely rethinking how we build customer support experiences. It's about developing faster and cheaper, and at scale.

The company operates across many different national markets in Europe, offering customer service in five languages, and plans to expand to the US.\nTo keep up with this strong growth, N26 faced the challenge of scaling customer service. N26 decided to investigate using AI to improve customer experience and operational efficiency, through faster responses to customer service chats.\nN26 found existing cloud-based solutions werent able to fulfill its customization and data protection needs. In addition, the company wanted to automate complex, back-and-forth conversations.\nThe Solution\nUsing Rasa, N26 was able to get from idea to production in just four weeks. N26 deployed the assistant on their secure cloud environment with full data control.\nA product team consisting of data scientists, designers, developers, and product managers, worked closely with customer service to identify the major use cases. Specifically, the team was able to handle more complex conversations using Rasas machine learning-based dialogue AI instead of hand-crafting each rule.\nNow the AI assistant is running in five different languages in their mobile and web app, even handling complex tasks such as reports of credit cards being lost or stolen.\nThe Results\nN26s team was able to tweak the machine learning models to peak performance with their own data sets. Soon after going live in the mobile app, N26 quickly saw 20% of customer service requests handled by the AI assistant. N26 is working on bringing this to 30% and beyond.\nWith Rasa, we were able to scale our customer service and grow our user base significantly, and still provide the best customer experience.

Catering to a diverse portfolio of businesses across the U.S., the company enables its clients to accelerate growth, strengthen brand visibility, and maximize marketing effectiveness. With a reputation for operational discipline and ethical standards, the client sought to modernize its Accounts Payable function to boost efficiency, minimize errors, and increase financial predictability.\nThe Challenge\nManual Processes and Poor Visibility Undermining Financial Control\nDespite its strong operational foundation, the clients Accounts Payable (AP) operations relied heavily on manual intervention. This resulted in inefficiencies, increased error risk, and led to missed opportunities for financial savings and cash flow optimization. Limited visibility into AP performance further hindered proactive decision-making and SLA compliance.\nInvoice Cycle Time:\nThe SLA required processing 98% of invoices within three days, yet performance lagged:\n78% of invoices processed in <3 days\n20% processed in 410 days\n2% processed after 10 days\nThis shortfall caused SLA breaches, slowed vendor payments, and increased financial risk\nError Rate:\nWhile overall accuracy averaged 99.5%, the remaining 0.5% of manual errors represented a consistent source of rework, payment delays, and vendor dissatisfaction.\nDuplicate Payments: \nRecurring issue, especially with one-time vendors\nRefund delays from vendors often strained cash flow\nSignificant loss of agent time in investigations and reconciliations\nEarly Payment Discounts:\nAlthough $20K per month in early payment discounts was captured, analysis showed untapped potential to significantly improve this figurerepresenting lost savings opportunities.\nSutherland Solution\nAutomation, Analytics, and Standardization Powering a Future-Ready AP Model\nSutherland redesigned the clients Accounts Payable operations using a comprehensive solution integrating automation, data insights, and robust process governance delivering a faster, more accurate, and data-driven AP function.\nData-Driven AP Strategy \nReal-time dashboards enabled visibility into overdue invoices, vendor discount tracking, and payment aging trends\nBetter forecasting prevented accounts from aging into higher-risk buckets, resulting in cash flow predictability\nAutomation-First Invoice Management \nDeployed Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to streamline payment batch preparation, freight invoice downloads, vendor statement processing, and intercompany invoice automation\nIntroduced Prodigy AP and a vendor inquiry cockpit to centralize and simplify interactions\nDelivered productivity savings equivalent to 7 FTEs, freeing capacity for higher-value work\nProcess Structuring and Standardization \nStandardized Statement of Accounts and utility invoice tracking to ensure timely reconciliation and payments\nQuality and Error Prevention Controls \nImplemented audit checks and preventive action protocols to detect and eliminate errors early\nConsistently maintained invoice error rates below 0.1%, exceeding industry benchmarks\nThe Outcome\nPredictable, Scalable, and Insight-Rich AP Operations\nSutherlands solution transformed the clients accounts payable function into a more resilient, predictable, and financially optimized operation. What was once a reactive, manual process is now a streamlined, digitally governed function with real-time control and tangible business impact. Invoice cycle times improved significantly, with the percentage of invoices processed in under 3 days increasing from 78% to 90%, while those taking 410 days dropped from 20% to 9.5%, and invoices exceeding 10 days were reduced from 2% to just 0.5%. Accuracy also improved, as the error rate fell from 0.5% to under 0.1%, and a 99% duplicate payment avoidance rate was achieved through intelligent automation and process rigor. In parallel, the organization captured more value through early payment discounts, which grew from $20K to over $25K per month. Together, these improvements not only enhanced efficiency but also contributed to a stronger cash position and greater operational transparency across the AP function.\nThats digital outcomes

Transportation, Hospitality & Logistics\nServices: IoT+ as a Service\nClient Overview\nA North American regional airline serving passengers and cargo sought a streamlined and audit-ready approach to collect, validate, and report GHG (Green House Gas) emissions data to meet rising ESG and sustainability disclosure requirements.\nThe Challenge\nPreviously, the airline relied on fragmented spreadsheets and manual processes to track greenhouse gas emissions across its fleet and operations. This led to inconsistent data, time-consuming reporting cycles, and difficulty aligning with evolving ESG disclosure standards. With regulatory pressure and stakeholder expectations increasing, the airline needed a centralized, audit-ready approach to ESG data management that could ensure accuracy, efficiency, and compliance.\nSutherland Solution\nSutherland streamlined the airlines GHG reporting process by designing a structured approach for data collection, validation, and consolidation across fleet and operational sources.\nOur team replaced fragmented spreadsheets with standardized templates, performed rigorous checks to ensure data accuracy and consistency, and applied recognized emission factors for precise calculations. We also developed disclosure-ready reporting packs aligned with aviation sustainability and ESG requirements, enabling the airline to meet regulatory expectations and build stakeholder confidence without adding new technology platforms.\nThe Outcome\n95%+ Data Accuracy  Achieved audit-ready, validated GHG data across operations.\n30% Faster Reporting  Reduced reporting cycle time through structured templates and streamlined validation.\nRegulatory Alignment  Produced disclosure-ready reports consistent with aviation sustainability and ESG standards.\nStakeholder Confidence  Delivered transparent, reliable data that strengthened trust with regulators and investors.", "source_url": "https://www.sutherlandglobal.com/insights/case-study/north-american-airline-streamlined-ghg-reporting"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 584, "end": 593, "text": "reporting", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 927, "end": 936, "text": "reporting", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1308, "end": 1317, "text": "reporting", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1603, "end": 1606, "text": "30%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1634, "end": 1643, "text": "reporting", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1828, "end": 1850, "text": "Stakeholder Confidence", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1522, "end": 1525, "text": "95%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 102, "end": 105, "text": "IoT", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "How Stena Line ferries reinvented travel with the help of AI \nHow an AI assistant helps Stena Line Ferries reinvent travel for millions of customers\nTrending and new\n5 min read\n26th May 2021\nAI enthusiast | Tea addict | Focused on using AI assistants to win the working week \nCASE STUDY\nStena Line Ferries | Travel\nKey challenges\nOne of the largest ferry operators in the world today, Stena Line has always been an early adopter of AI. Almost a decade ago  way before it was even a buzz word, the team were keen to explore what was on the horizon for AI-powered travel assistance, but there was a lot of ground to cover.\nThey have 37 vessels that sail across multiple routes around Europe\nMillions of passengers with highly specific travel details need individual attendion\nInformation from many other business systems is needed to resolve enquiries\nKey results\nStena Line booked a call with us to find out how launching an AI assistant could help and Stina was created. A complex AI assistant supporting their passengers with everything from ticket bookings and travel arrangements, to where to park their car and find food on board.\nStina solves up to 99% of routine passenger queries for the ferry operator\nThe AI assistant is trained to support passengers on 25,000 sailings around Europe every year in six languages\nWhere most chatbots might link up with 1 or 2 business systems, next-gen AI assistant Stina connects to 20+\nNotable breakthroughs along the way\nStina has been trained to assist in many ways over the years, on the Stena Line website, their app, and even as a hologram\nAI helps the ferry operator uncover patterns in passenger behaviour that transforms their insight\nThe customer service teams benefit just as much as customers do from the use of AI\nIt takes just 10 minutes to launch an AI assistant\nYears ago, it was a long-winded, expensive and highly technical process for Stena Line to launch their AI assistant. Now, things are far quicker, easier, and cheaper:\nAny member of your team can manage your AI assistant (you dont need any technical skill)\nYou can easily add new features to scale AI-driven support over time\nYour security and compliance responsibilities are all taken care of\nTheres a human in the loop to help continuously improve your AI assistants performance\nAll you need to get started is your website url  its that simple!\nStena Line creates waves in the travel industry using AI to make an impact\nUsing an AI assistant to navigate the ebb and flow of enterprise and technology systems in travel and tourism, Stena Line relied on our long history in data engineering to help catch every AI opportunity in the net.\nThey chose the name and avatar, and have full control over every response Stina sends out to their valuable customers, which can be edited any time.\nAll they need to check Stinas progress is on their client dashboard:\n(Data shown is for illustrative purposes only) \nStena Line now easily adapts to what passengers need on the go and in real time\nStena Lines AI journey began with a Facebook messenger chatbot in the early days of artificial intelligence. As live chat and smartphone technology progressed, so did our AI assistants. Stina became more than just a chat widget, bringing AI power to Stena Lines Travel Mate app and their UK website.\nThe AI assistant was trained to answer passengers in five more languages besides English, so their customers in Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Norway and the Netherlands could chat online too. At one point, Stina was even a hologram, designed to use onboard Stena Line ferries to give their passengers information in real-time, exactly at the point they need it.\nUsing AI, the travel company can reinvent Stina any time depending on what their customers need from them most  right now.\nOur conversation review service means Stina is always at peak performance\nStina has artificial intelligence, so doesnt learn in the same way we do. Its our team of psychologists, analysts, designers and writers that makes sure Stina gives out the correct information to customers, every time and without fail. Theyre continually reviewing conversations between Stena Line passengers and Stina (any personal information is automatically removed), looking for patterns to see where improvements can be made. Having this human in the loop performing vital conversation review helps guide the decisions the ferry company makes, showing where travel services can improve and what takes priority.\nStena Line can easily change direction\nKeeping a constant check on conversations means its spotted straight away if questions start to come in that are new, say theres a situation local to a particular port or a global change to travel restrictions. Our review team is the first to see this shift and can quickly give Stina new, relevant information to keep the chat flowing.\nMass communications a breeze with an AI assistant on board\nSince tens of thousands of passengers can all speak to an AI assistant at the same time, one change to the information Stina gives out can reach countless passengers at once.\nStena Line can see the most popular queries any time on their client dashboard to keep Stina on track no matter what happens along the way.\nEvery Stena Line customer can have their say\nUsing an AI assistant brings Stena Line closer to their customers because they talk more often and in real-time. As well as using the data they get from the things people say to Stina to keep the exchange fresh, they can also ask for in the moment feedback at the end of every chat. This means they can take on board the emotional impact of the customer experience to tweak any aspect that can be improved.\nStina is incredibly well connected with seamless integration to other systems\nRather than use many different technology companies to delicately connect their AI assistant with their business systems, Stena Line can rely on our 20+ years of data engineering experience to create one seamless network. The best bit is, our AI platform isnt restricted to any one technology and integrations are unlimited, so whatever Stena Line wants to do next and with whichever technology, theyll always get the best tech available to keep their plans moving in the right direction.\nStina can appear on any device, anywhere\nModern ferries might not look too different to when they first set sail at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the technology used to run them sure does. For Stena Line, the beauty of using AI to speak instantly with any customer passing through their terminals is Stina can appear on land or at sea on any device. As times change (and so do those devices), the ferry company can quickly change direction whenever they need to, making use of precise knowledge about every passenger.\nIt's plain sailing for Stena Line with the help of AI\nStena Line has been flying the flag for AI since 2015 with a near-perfect success rate, not just moving with the times, but drawing the map for other travel companies that want to explore AI too, giving them the freedom to keep creating more joyful experiences for their customers.\nPassengers will start to see more real-time interaction onboard with Stina, helping them with anything they need, instantly, whenever they need it, at any time of the night or day.\nIt makes travelling with Stena Line the thing every traveller wants: effortless and stress-free.\nLaunch an AI assistant today (or ask us to do it)\nIts easy to use our AI Studio to create and manage your own AI assistant, or you can choose our managed service and ask us to do it all for you.

Built for enterprise speed, scale, and control.Learn more\nMobilizing a Nationwide Emergency Response to COVID-19\nIn the face of a pandemic, PicPay rises to the challenge of distributing aid to families across Brazil, using Rasa.\nExplore Rasa\nThe Challenge\nPicPay serves a rapidly growing customer base of 20 million customers and counting, the largest user base of any payment app in Brazil. But with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the challenges of scale took on a new urgency.\nThe Brazilian government selected PicPay as the payment app through which all emergency aid funds would be paid out to families across Brazil. Through the PicPay app, users would be able to validate whether they qualified for aid with the Brazilian government and claim their benefits.\nThe logistical challenges of the plan were considerable: a spike in customer service contacts, a user base with limited digital literacy, and above all, a mandate to roll out a solution in weeks, not months.\nTo manage the expected volume and ensure all users were able to access their benefits regardless of tech savviness, PicPay designed a conversational interface: an AI assistant that led users through the entire process.\nThe Solution\nWith time of the essence, PicPay chose Rasa to provide the framework for conversational AI. The teams past experience with Rasa made it a top contender during the evaluation process, and ultimately Rasa was selected over IBM Watson on the basis of both cost and accuracy. Another deciding factor was Rasas open source approach and the visibility it offered into constant improvements within the product, as well as the ability to support language localization in Portuguese.\nPicPays team of developers, content editors, and data scientists worked closely with the Rasa Customer Success Engineering team to meet an ambitious launch deadline of just two weeks. 10 business days later, on May 13, the PicPay assistant was live in production.\nThe Results\nIn just the first hour, PicPays assistant handled 3,000 transactions, averaging 100,000 users per day during the first week. Traffic has remained high ever since, with the assistant handling between 20k and 65k interactions per day.\nWith a combination of technology and nimble development, PicPay was able to mobilize the distribution of aid across Brazil. The success of PicPays Rasa assistant has led the team to look toward future improvements, including integration with Zendesk and WhatsApp.\nWith the help of the Rasa team we managed to put an assistant in production and go live within 10 business days. Rasa is portable, scalable, and its very easy to develop a chatbot application on Rasa.\nIsaac Ben-Akiva, Chief Data & AI Officer\n\nIndustry: Financial Services\nLocation: So Paulo, Brazil\nEmployees: 1,100\nSee more companies addressing Covid-19 with conversational AI ", "source_url": "https://rasa.com/customers/picpay/"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 16, "end": 26, "text": "Rasa Voice", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1005, "end": 1010, "text": "weeks", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1016, "end": 1022, "text": "months", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1187, "end": 1199, "text": "AI assistant", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1329, "end": 1346, "text": "conversational AI", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1902, "end": 1916, "text": "just two weeks", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1918, "end": 1940, "text": "10 business days later", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1945, "end": 1951, "text": "May 13", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2013, "end": 2032, "text": "just the first hour", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2120, "end": 2134, "text": "the first week", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2202, "end": 2213, "text": "between 20k", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2218, "end": 2221, "text": "65k", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2604, "end": 2620, "text": "10 business days", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2711, "end": 2726, "text": "Isaac Ben-Akiva", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2871, "end": 2888, "text": "conversational AI", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 46, "end": 56, "text": "enterprise", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "Order-to-Cash Transformation for Global Logistics Leader\nIndustry: Travel, Transportation, Hospitality & Logistics | Services: Digital Operations, Data & Analytics, Intelligent Automation, \nClient Overview\nThe client is the worlds largest package delivery and logistics company with over $97 billion in annual revenue and a global workforce of nearly 500,000. The sheer scale of its integrated networkspanning shipping, freight, and supply chain servicesplaces it in highly complex, regulated and competitive environments. That said, operational precision and working capital efficiency are not merely goals, but fundamental drivers of its profitability and market leadership.\nThe Challenge\nLegacy Systems and Fragmented Operations Limiting Cash Flow and Scalability\nThe clients Order-to-Cash (O2C) function across its EMEA footprint was hampered by significant systemic inefficiencies. At the core of the issue was a reliance on a patchwork of legacy systems that supported fragmented, manual, and country-specific operations. This technological and procedural fragmentation severely inhibited scalability, denied the business real-time visibility, and fundamentally undermined effective working capital management.\nKey Challenges:\nDisparate systems and processes across multiple European markets\nHigh operational costs driven by manual effort\nInefficient collections resulting in delayed cash realization and poor delinquency predictability\nLimited scalability to support business growth across languages and geographies\nFragmented customer interactions impacting First Call Resolution (FCR) and experience\nLack of a centralized, scalable hub for shared services delivery\nThe client needed to consolidate operations, improve productivity and increase cash flow while ensuring a seamless transition with minimal change resistance.\nSutherland Solution\nDigitally Reimagining Order-to-Cash with Automation, Analytics and GBS Expansion\nSutherland deployed a multi-pronged transformation strategy designed to deliver scale, agility, and financial outcomes:\nOperating Model Design & GBS Setup: Established a Global Business Services (GBS) hub in Alexandria, Egypt, with 150+ FTEs, later scaled to cover ~200 FTEs across EMEA, supporting five languages.\nIntelligent Automation Enablement: Reconfigured the Automation Center of Excellence (CoE) using Sutherland Robility, enabling rapid automation of manual processes within Collections and beyond.\nAdvanced Collections with Collect AI: Deployed predictive analytics and delinquency models to improve collection prioritization, reduce roll-forward rates and enhance cash flow visibility.\nProcess Re-Design Beyond Scope: Extended value by redesigning upstream and downstream processes across Pricing, Billing, Collections and Cash Application to drive better alignment and outcomes.\nCX360 Deployment: Enabled customer-level insights to improve First Call Resolution, lower Average Handle Time and elevate service experience.\nThe Outcome\nSignificant Working Capital Gains and Scalable O2C Excellence\nSutherlands comprehensive end-to-end Order-to-Cash (O2C) transformation unlocked significant working capital gains and established a scalable foundation for operational excellence.\nThrough the use of predictive delinquency modeling and advanced analytics, the engagement delivered over $150 million in improved cash flow, while a 1.5% reduction in Roll Forward Rate accelerated revenue realization. Automation across finance and accounting functions drove a 40% improvement in productivity, enhancing process efficiency and throughput.\nAs part of a global strategy, a multi-lingual Global Business Services (GBS) hub was established in a new EMEA market, enabling scalable support for regional growth. Simultaneously, the customer experience was elevated through higher first contact resolution (FCR) and reduced average handle time (AHT). Ultimately, this comprehensive transformation not only optimized the clients working capital but also established the groundwork for long-term, GBS-led growth across Europe, creating a sustainable competitive advantage.\nThats digital outcomes delivered!\nSutherlands success in delivering a digitally powered O2C transformation led to long-term strategic alignment with the client and further GBS expansion opportunities.", "source_url": "https://www.sutherlandglobal.com/insights/case-study/order-to-cash-transformation-for-global-logistics-leader"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 154, "end": 163, "text": "Analytics", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 289, "end": 300, "text": "$97 billion", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 304, "end": 310, "text": "annual", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1221, "end": 1235, "text": "Key Challenges", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1909, "end": 1918, "text": "Analytics", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2252, "end": 2274, "text": "Intelligent Automation", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2348, "end": 2368, "text": "Sutherland Robility", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2456, "end": 2467, "text": "Collections", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2872, "end": 2880, "text": "insights", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3329, "end": 3346, "text": "over $150 million", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3378, "end": 3382, "text": "1.5%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3506, "end": 3509, "text": "40%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 289, "end": 292, "text": "$97", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3334, "end": 3338, "text": "$150", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1361, "end": 1372, "text": "collections", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2423, "end": 2434, "text": "Collections", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2758, "end": 2769, "text": "Collections", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4098, "end": 4107, "text": "advantage", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3284, "end": 3302, "text": "advanced analytics", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2348, "end": 2367, "text": "Sutherland Robility", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 165, "end": 187, "text": "Intelligent Automation", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "03. Omnichannel & data advantage\nPart 3\nPhone, chat, Q&As, webpages  the average consumer uses two different channels for CX, and 30% of consumers use three or more.7\nBe sure to offer your customers multiple ways to contact you and resolve the issues they might have with your products and services.\nUse customer insights to help you navigate which channels are preferred and which ones make the most sense for your business.\nBut thats just the start. You must remember that customers are not simply moving between channels, theyre also moving between devices  mobile to desktop, phone to smart speaker. The experience must be optimized for all interfaces and channels must be integrated to offer a seamless, omnichannel experience.\nSelf-service: Help your customers help themselves\nOne-in-four (25%) consumers actively want to solve their own problems.\nYet, only 3% currently prioritize self-service as their channel of choice and only 10% of respondents believe, based on their experiences, that self-service can provide the level of assistance they need.8\nSelf-service presents a major opportunity for organizations and for disruptors if its set up the right way. Answers must be easy to find on the website, with online Q&As and bots. A well-structured self-service not only participates in increasing customer satisfaction but also helps reduce the cost to serve as simple requests and issues can be resolved without the intervention of an agent.\nAutomation\nYou can leverage automation to offer the best possible service in terms of solving requests and availability. However, you need to get it right. Despite the fast progress made by AI, machine learning and technologies such as natural language understanding (NLU)...\n... Foundever research shows that just 17% of consumers believe they could get the assistance they need from an automated or digital channel. \nAs for the most common kind of automation in CX, chatbots, 22% of consumers say they want to use them, but only very few do so on a regular basis.\nNew technologies offer new opportunities. One of them clearly stands out and will change CX automation: generative AI. Its evolving fast and will soon be able to offer natural-language conversations instead of closed-choice questions.\nOf course, generative AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The unique needs of your customers, within the context of a specific customer journey, must be considered  along with the business requirements of your brand  when defining how, when and if generative AI is to be used as part of the broader customer engagement strategy.\nCase study\nAn award-winning chatbot for a fashion retailer\nThis well-known retailer partnered with Foundever to launch a digital agent. Besides personalized and fun 24/7 support, it also offers tailored shopping advice, order tracking and product exchange automation through automated image analysis with an automation rate of over 80%.\nThe project has expanded to include 9 bots in 6 languages and 32 countries.\nTo help with high volumes of contact and provide support on the brands website, Facebook and WhatsApp, Foundever implemented a tailored chatbot solution, including automated image analysis for exchange requests and efficient integration with Salesforce for order tracking and returns.\nThe 3D bot persona provides a fun and human-like experience that goes beyond digital CX to become the brands ambassador on social media.\n+244%\nAverage ROI growth per year\n10 days to 15 sec\nDecrease in real-time resolution of exchange requests\n62%\nSales conversion increase with the Personal Shopper feature\nSocial media as a CX channel\nSocial media has become part of everyday life, and more consumers use it every day to interact with brands.\nThat makes it the perfect opportunity for your brand to meet customers where theyre at and connect with them on these platforms.\nOffer your customers social media care, a specialist service that extends your customer support beyond traditional mediums to the social media channels your customers prefer. Brands can use their social media channels in previously unimagined ways. You can provide superior customer support, protect your brands reputation, sell to customers, and identify opportunities by staying ahead of trends and competition.\nThe power of your data\nWith digital CX channels in place, you have access to a wealth of data about your customers and their sentiment regarding your brand.\nCollecting this data is the easy part. And many of your customers (38%) are willing to share personal information if it improves their experience with your brand.9\nHowever, to unleash the power of your data, you need to add analytics to the mix and transform basic information into actionable insights. Analyzing all interactions with your customers will then allow you to understand customer trends and sentiments and personalize their experience.\nData security: A priority for Foundever\nInsights for your business\nInsights can be used as powerful decision-making tools and allow you to develop a truly customer-led business strategy.\nTo achieve this, you need technology such as speech and text analytics and a level of expertise that you might not find in-house. Fortunately, there are partners you can team up with to make the most of the wealth of data at your disposal.\nOne thing to keep in mind  be careful about data security! Even if more than one-third of consumers are willing to share their data for better CX, they need reassurance that their personal information is protected.\nMake sure you team up with a partner that offers a cream-of-the-crop data security policy.\nSpotlight\nSocial media CX by Foundever\nFoundever has more than 15 years of social customer experience recognized by top awards and analyst agencies, such as a Global Leader in Social Media CX Services according to ISG Provider Lens.10 \nWe match your pain points with the right solution for social care, whether its to address negative brand sentiment, high reply time, brand crises or having no insights from customers.\nProven, measurable results from some of our clients using our social media care solutions after one year:\n200%\nimprovement in brand sentiment\n100%\nimprovement in reply time\n66%\nreply rate improvement\nKey takeaways\nCreate an omnichannel experience\nCreate a seamless omnichannel experience.

Transportation, Hospitality & Logistics | Services: Digital CX, Digital Operations, Intelligent Automation\nClient Overview\nAs one of the worlds largest logistics companies, our client operates on an immense scale , operating in over 220 countries and territories and delivering more than 1.8 billion shipments annually. With over 80 billion in revenue, its UK B2C segment alone processes nearly 600,000 transactions yearly . At this massive volume, maintaining flawless and responsive receivables operations is critical to optimizing working capital and ensuring customer satisfaction across its diverse lines of business.\nThe Challenge\nHigh DSO, Manual Workflows and Operational Inflexibility Across B2C AR\nDespite its global scale, the client faced mounting challenges within its UK Accounts Receivable (AR) function. The legacy operating model, characterized by its reliance on manual processes and fragmented systems, created significant friction.\nInconsistent Collection Performance: Manual payment allocation and a lack of real-time visibility into customer accounts led to inconsistent and inefficient collection efforts.\nOperational Inflexibility: Fragmented customer engagement channels and a lack of predictive analytics hindered proactive payment risk management. The time-consuming payment allocation process created a bottleneck, impacting upstream finance processes.\nMounting Financial Risk: As a direct result of these inefficiencies, the client experienced rising write-offs and mounting bad debt. The legacy systems inability to adapt to real-time customer needs further compounded this financial exposure.\nTo remain competitive and future-ready, the client recognized the critical need for a digital transformation of its Order-to-Cash (O2C) ecosystem. This initiative was not merely about operational improvement; it was about building a more resilient, responsive, and data-driven finance function.\nSutherland Solution\nDigitally Powered O2C Transformation with Prodigy, Robility and Predictive Analytics\nSutherland delivered a comprehensive end-to-end transformation across the clients B2C AR function by combining advanced digital tools with intelligent process redesign:\nGlobal Operating Model: Transitioned the UK B2C AR to a scalable and standardized global operations framework.\nPayment Digitization: Rolled out secure IVR and web payment portals aligned with PCI DSS Level 1 standards to improve self-service and reduce dependency on agent-led collections.\nSutherland Prodigy Platform: Enabled integrated query management, centralized remit processing, and real-time payment referencing for faster dispute resolution. \nRobility-Powered Auto Allocation: Introduced intelligent automation bots to accelerate payment matching  reducing turnaround time and manual intervention.\nPredictive Analytics: Used risk-based segmentation and propensity-to-pay models to prioritize outreach efforts and drive smarter collections.\nOmnichannel Engagement: Deployed SMS alerts and chat support to increase contact effectiveness and resolution speed, especially during peak cycles.\nThe Outcome\nStronger Collections, Faster Allocation and Reduced Write-Offs\nSutherlands transformation of the clients Accounts Receivable operations dramatically improved performance, agility, and customer experience. Monthly collection rate achievement surged from 90% to 105%, consistently exceeding internal KPIs. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) related to duty and VAT dropped from 30 days to 20.8 days, representing a 30% reduction and unlocking substantial working capital.\nAuto-allocation turnaround time was reduced from 72 to 24 hours, with accuracy reaching 98.87%, significantly streamlining cash application. At the same time, monthly bad debt was halved from 120K to 60K, lowering the rate from 5% to 3%, while 500K in annual write-off savings were achieved through enhanced query management and payment transparency. On the customer service front, 98% of calls were answered within 30 seconds, delivering a best-in-class AR contact center experience. This high-impact engagement evolved into a long-term strategic partnership, anchored in continuous innovation and shared accountability for outcomes.\nThats digital outcomes delivered!\nFollowing the success of the O2C transformation, Sutherland became the clients strategic partner for ongoing digital finance innovation and operations  with full accountability for measurable business outcomes",

In addition, more than 85% of finance operations were transitioned to right-shored Centers of Excellence. At the same time, a comprehensive CFO dashboard with over 75 outcome-centric reports was deployed to support data-driven decision-making. The optimized delivery model also enabled a 40% reduction in expansion costs. Collectively, these initiatives drove an underwritten productivity uplift of 38% across finance operations, reinforcing Sutherlands commitment to delivering intelligent, scalable solutions that drive enterprise agility, operational excellence, and sustained performance.\nThats digital outcomes delivered!\nFollowing the successful implementation, Sutherland solidified its role as the clients long-term transformation partner, supporting the operationalization of a global, digital-first finance platform that enables both growth and exit strategies.", "source_url": "https://www.sutherlandglobal.com/insights/case-study/digitally-transforming-finance-and-accounting-for-global-manufacturer"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 128, "end": 150, "text": "Intelligent Automation", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 284, "end": 290, "text": "annual", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 302, "end": 314, "text": "$3.3 billion", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 403, "end": 406, "text": "20+", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1272, "end": 1274, "text": "22", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1659, "end": 1707, "text": "Lift-Shift-Transform & Transform-Shift Strategy:", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1958, "end": 1980, "text": "intelligent automation", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3057, "end": 3071, "text": "60 to 20 hours", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3078, "end": 3086, "text": "over 75%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3126, "end": 3130, "text": "days", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3174, "end": 3181, "text": "2.4-day", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3199, "end": 3202, "text": "18%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3223, "end": 3230, "text": "monthly", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3288, "end": 3310, "text": "an average of two days", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3325, "end": 3338, "text": "more than 85%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3600, "end": 3603, "text": "40%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3711, "end": 3714, "text": "38%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 302, "end": 304, "text": "$3", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3083, "end": 3086, "text": "75%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3335, "end": 3338, "text": "85%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3231, "end": 3242, "text": "collections", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1895, "end": 1910, "text": "Hyperautomation", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3131, "end": 3136, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 333, "end": 343, "text": "enterprise", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3835, "end": 3845, "text": "enterprise", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "Generali Insures a Future-Ready Workforce With AI-Infused Learning\nCASE STUDY Generali \nA strategic talent development program empowers the insurance companys people with enduring skills and continuous growth opportunities\n3-MINUTE READ\nJune 12, 2025\nWhat Generali achieved\n100%\nengagement, making continuous upskilling a shared commitment\n32.7\ntraining hours completed per employee\n1200\nsenior managers being trained on generative AI\nIn todays rapidly evolving insurance landscape, upskilling is no longer optionalits essential.

Voicebot\nStatistics:\n70% fewer authentications by agents\n30% lower standard complaint processing by agents\n6 weeks to go live\nAbout the Companies\nMedien Hub Bremen-Nordwest, is a joint venture of Nordwest-Zeitung and WESER-KURIER, specializes in comprehensive services for online product, customer, and process management for a network of regional publishers in the Northwest of Germany.The MSP Medien Systempartner, another joint venture, provides support as an IT consultant and service provider in the design and optimization of business and IT processes, applications, and system landscapes.\nThe SC Soft-Concept GmbH is an expert in CRM, AI, customer/partner portals, and enterprise integration. Its industry focus is on media and publishing, telecommunications, and professional services, which range from management consulting and requirements analysis to implementation and training.\nAt a Glance\nWith a stunning six week turnaround, the team of Medien Hub Bremen-Nordwest, MSP Medien Systempartner, and SC Soft-Concept redefined the rules of the game for their customer service with Parloa's AI Voicebot. 30% of all standard complaints are now processed at lightening speed and fully automatically by the Parloa AI Voicebot, which means enormous relief for the agents. On top of that, 70% of callers are now identified immediately, for more efficiency in customer service  and happy customers!\nParloa is extremely exciting for us because the focus is on voice, and we were able to integrate it seamlessly into our existing IT infrastructure, enabling us to go live after just six weeks of the project.\nFabian Rosekeit, Projektleiter - Head of CRM & Growth, Medien Hub Bremen-Nordwest\nThe Challenge\nRegional media companies such as the Nordwest-Zeitung from Oldenburg and the WESER-KURIER from Bremen are primarily growing through digital subscriptions. Despite this, the majority of the 200,000 subscribers receive the traditional print edition of their daily newspaper delivered to their homes hot off the press in the early hours of the morning  a process that includes complex logistics.\nDelays in delivery are caused by general staff shortages or short-term absences due to illness. In the worst case, a newspaper may not be delivered at all.\nAlthough readers receive digital information about delays and can easily alert the paper of a delivery breakdown online or via an app, many still prefer to contact them by phone. For the agents, this meant recurring calls and long queues.For subscribers, this meant long waiting times and, on top of not being able to read their newspaper, an unsatisfactory service experience.Nordwest-Zeitung and WESER-KURIER recognized the opportunity for innovation and decided to use the AI Voicebot as part of their customer service team.\nThe objectives of project MVP were clearly defined:\nAgent relief via AI Voicebot should take over 20% of telephone complaints and process them on a case-by-case basis.\nCustomer service availability should significantly increase, especially at peak times.\nSeamless integration of the AI solution into the media companies' existing technical infrastructure, including the telephone system, SAP, and Salesforce.\nThe AI Voicebot should prevent cancellations from poor customer service availability.\nImplementation of an MVP should happen as fast as possible, to grant agents immediate relief.\nThe Solution\nMedien Hub Bremen-Nordwest and MSP Medien Systempartner chose to start the project together with SC Soft-Concept because of their extensive expertise in the publishing industry, their understanding of the technical infrastructure of both media companies, and long-standing cooperation.\nSC Soft-Concept brought Parloa into the project. The contact center AI solution meets the high demands of the industry and customer service with high-quality, authentic voice AI.\nThe use of Parloa Voice AI is a big step from sender-oriented IVR systems towards natural, customer-oriented dialogue. Our customers can speak the way they do in everyday life - in complete, clear sentences. And the technology understands exactly what they want to say. Now the customers are in charge!\nFabian Rosekeit, Project Lead - Head of CRM & Growth, Medien Hub Bremen-Nordwest\nFast Implementation Thanks to Preconfigured Solutions\nA key step in maximizing the performance of the voicebot was Parloas seamless integration into existing systems.\nSC Soft-Concept was able to provide pre-prepared components and Parloa supplied the appropriate interfaces. With the connection to the telephone system, a preconfigured Salesforce integration, and trained call flows, the media companies were able to accelerate the implementation of their MVP to go live quickly and achieve immediate results.\n6 Weeks from Idea to MVP\nWith a lean and dynamic team, the Nordwest-Zeitung and the WESER-KURIER are focused on flexibility and responsiveness.\nInvolving the agents was an important part of the process right from the start, allowing their experience and best practices to flow directly into the dialogue design.\nThis agile and team-oriented approach made it possible to execute the project in just six weeks.\nUse Case on Complaints: Intuitive Detection and Immediate Processing \nEvery incoming call is forwarded directly to the Parloa Voicebot. Thanks to the direct connection to the CRM, callers are immediately identified by telephone number, making extensive customer information such as order details, delivery information, or existing tickets instantly available.\nA key element of the process is issue recognition. The AI bot specifically asks \"What can I do for you?\" and gives callers the freedom to phrase their concerns as if they were speaking to human agents.\nJulius Gaismayer, SC Soft-Concept\nThen AI supports decisions on how best to process the customer's request. In the event of complaints, callers are verified via zip code. Any problems are included in the dialogue, like the absence of delivery staff.\nComplaints are automatically recorded and booked in Salesforce and SAP IS-Media via the interface provided by MSP  including possible refunds.a\nThe Results:\nParloa's AI technology showed impressive results right from the start..\nFrom the very first day, the Voicebot not only achieved the goals we had set, but exceeded them.\nJohanna Drachenberg, Reader Market & Marketing Lead, WESER-KURIER Mediengruppe\nThe agents who primarily interact with customers also felt that their workload had been significantly reduced and were amazed at the efficiency of the voicebot. Thanks to targeted training and the opportunity to provide feedback, they were able to quickly adjust to new processes and have been able to continue to optimize the dialogues.\nOverview of the MVPs results:\nIncreased efficiency: 30% of telephone complaints are now processed automatically by the AI Voicebot  10% more than originally planned.\nAuthentication: 70% of all customers can be identified by their telephone number. This rate will increase as telephone numbers are added to the CRM.\nFast implementation: The project launched in six weeks.\nTechnical integration: Both media companies, the phone system, Salesforce, and SAP were integrated smoothly within a month.\nService quality: Customer service availability has significantly improved.\nSatisfaction: Both customers and agents are more satisfied.\nCustomer loyalty: Improved service allows the company to avoid subscription cancellations.\nThe benefits for our customers are enormous  complaints are now processed within seconds. They used to experience long wait times before they could even speak to an employee. The feedback is definitely positive.\nUwe Mork, Head of Sales & Service, Nordwest Mediengruppe\nWhat happens next?\nExpanding feedback options: In addition to current complaints, customers will also be able to submit complaints for past periods via AI Voicebot in future. This will continue to refine the service process and increase customer satisfaction.\nIntegrating vacation service: Another important step on the roadmap is the implementation of vacation service.

With Parloas GenAI technology, the company has embraced a new approach to serviceone that blends cutting-edge efficiency with human-like empathy.\nAt the WAVE 2024 conference, Paul Herbertz, Product Manager for Communication Infrastructure at BarmeniaGothaers Wuppertal office, introduced their new AI Agent, Mina. He explained that Mina represents a new era of customer service, one in which technology not only automates processes but also meaningfully enhances customer experience.\nThe Challenge: Smarter Call Routing for a Better Customer Experience\nFor BarmeniaGothaer, getting customers to the right place quickly and seamlessly was a priority. At their Wuppertal location, this meant routing calls to over 50 possible destinations, which placed significant strain on the switchboard. Customers often faced delays, and the process didnt always feel as smooth or personal as they wanted it to.\nThe solution had to do more than just streamline operations. It was determined to maintain a sense of connection, ensuring that customers felt heard, understood, and cared for.\nThe Solution: Mina, the AI Agent\nMinas setup began with a clear plan: What role would she play? How would she communicate with customers? What values should she convey? \nWith the support of Parloas AI Agent Management Platform (AMP), BarmeniaGothaer brought Mina to life. Designed to embody the companys values, Mina was named after a local sculpture in Wuppertal, symbolizing her connection to the community.\nMina took on the complex task of call routing, ensuring that every customer was directed to the right department with precision and speed. Her impact was immediate: she reduced the workload on the switchboard in Wuppertal by 90%, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex inquiries.\nWhat makes Mina exceptional is her ability to communicate with empathy. Instead of relying on traditional IVR menus, she engages customers in natural, human-like conversations. She asks the right questions and understands the intent behind them, ensuring every interaction feels personal and solution-oriented.\nMina in Action\nMina represents a great leap forward in customer service technology  but her role goes beyond the theoretical. Her value is proven every day in her interactions with customers.\nTake the following examples:\nForgotten activation code: A customer called about an issue with an activation code. Mina understood the request, asked specific questions, and responded professionally and with understanding.\nCanceling cat insurance: In an unusual case, a customer wanted to cancel their cat insurance. A minor transcription error interpreted \"cat\" as \"card,\" but Mina picked up on the context. With clear and friendly follow-up questions, she resolved the misunderstanding.\nThese examples show not only how Mina works efficiently but also how she is able to come across as human. She asks the right questions, responds appropriately to uncertainties, and remains polite and attentive throughout.\nEmpathy Meets Efficiency\nThis makes Mina is more than just a bot  but an agent who is strengthening relationships with BarmeniaGothaer Insurances customers. In fact, a recent internal survey revealed that 60% of customers felt their experience with Mina improved their perception of the company. Thats a huge achievement in an industry where automated solutions often feel impersonal or frustrating, and where trust is foundational to success.\nMinas own success is rooted in her ability to balance precision with empathy. While she handles complex routing seamlessly, she also brings a human-like quality to every interaction, making customers feel valued and heard.\nLooking Ahead: The Future of AI-Driven Customer Service\nOf course, Minas work is just beginning. As she continues to support the Wuppertal office, BarmeniaGothaer is looking to expand her capabilities. Future plans include:\nEnhancing her ability to handle more comp\nlex customer inquiries.\nExploring new use cases that extend beyond call routing, such as post-call follow-ups or email summaries of conversations.\nRefining her voice and dialogue to make interactions feel even more intuitive and natural.\nThe partnership between BarmeniaGothaer and Parloa demonstrates how generative AI can be used strategically  not just to improve efficiency but to reimagine what customer service can be. Minas success is a testament to what happens when technology and empathy come together to create meaningful change.\nDiscover how Parloa can help transform your customer service.

Their latest mission: solve one of the biggest pain points for customers: long wait times and a maze of service hotlines. \nBy partnering with Parloa and integrating AI agents for intelligent call routing, Wrttembergische transformed how they connect with their customers. The results: Within four weeks, callers reached the right expert a third faster, while human teams were freed up to focus on truly personal consultations.\nThe challenge\nEvery year, Wrttembergische handles around 300,000 calls through their main hotline alone. A quarter of these requests require direct handover to a specific specialist or even to another W&W Group company. Thisputs strain on service teams and often leaves customers frustrated with long waits.\nWrttembergische set out to solve this challenge with technology thats not only powerful but intuitive. And they chose Parloas AI agents to augment their service teams and deliver on their vision for customer-centric innovation.\nOur service experience began with waiting. We wanted to change thatby embracing innovation with AI. Parloa offered not just advanced AI technology, but also a true partnership, sharing our vision to put people at the center of excellent service, powered by AI.\nDr. Oliver Kleine, Head of Customer and Broker Service, Wrttembergische Versicherung AG\nFrom the get-go, the team at Wrttembergische were clear about their goals:\nShorten wait times on the phone\nRelieve the service team\nSave time for service teams so they can focus on personal advice and first-call resolutions\nBoost satisfaction for customers and employees alike\nIncrease operational efficiency\nThe solution\nBuilt on Parloa's AI agent management platform (AMP), the AI agent answers all calls on the main hotline in natural language, accurately classifies requests, and routes each caller to the right expertall while ensuring every step stays personal.

This gave them confidence the solution would perform reliably in the real world.\nThe solution was implemented through close, agile teamwork between Wrttembergische and Parloa, ensuring all requirements were embedded from day one. The AI agent not only answers calls, but is designed for ongoing evolution. Integration with telephony and CRM systems was seamless, and the AI models from the proof of concept were directly applied, accelerating go-live to just four months.\nA true highlight is the no-code system configuration. Using prompts alone, our service experts can configure and continuously improve the AI agentwithout relying on releases or IT support.\nFrederik Mayer, Project Lead and Head of Customer Service\nThe results\nWithin the first four weeks, Wrttembergisches AI agent delivered measurable impact for customers, service teams, and the company:\n33% call wait times reduction\n3.8 out of 5 average for the AI agent\nService staff are empowered to focus on personal advice\nGreater efficiency from automated, skill-based routing to the right expert\nWhats next\nWrttembergische is already expanding to new use cases, such as automated handling of routine requests like address changes and general inquiries.

HSE provides the most entertaining form of shopping and inspires 1.3 million active customers who can explore curated products ranging from fashion, jewelry, beauty, and wellness to household and lifestyle.\nThe company reaches around 46 million households in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland via three TV channels (HSE, HSE Extra and HSE Trend).\nAround 800 employees create an entertaining, customer-oriented shopping experience. Additionally, there are around 1800 external employees at logistics, call center, and tech development partners. HSE has received several awards for its outstanding service quality.\nThe bottom line\nIn just three months, HSE, Parloa, and the voice experts from MUUUH! managed to create a fully AI-controlled phonebot that processes telephone orders within a few minutes. This technology has been used by HSE since the beginning of 2022.\nCustomers decide when and where they shop at HSE, whether by phone, through the online store, or on social media. Up to 1,300 external customer advisors are supported by the AI-based phonebot EASY AI when they enter orders over the phone, which is capable of taking up to 600 calls simultaneously. EASY AI relieves the burden on service centers during busy periods and reduces the waiting time for customers on the order hotline. In addition to that, EASY AI takes over cross-selling activities by making individual product recommendations to customers and converting more sales.\nWe at HSE had a strong vision for the project. Together with Parloa and MUUUH! we managed to bring it to life: a modern conversational AI that not only improves the customer experience, but also helps us achieve our business goals.\nUwe Richter Director Customer Service at HSE\nWhat was the challenge?\nBefore working with Parloa, HSE was taking more than 2 million automated calls a year via a traditional hotline based on DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency).\nHowever, this traditional technology meant that HSE customers spent a long time on the phone, resulting in an experience that didnt keep up with the smartphone age.\nWe wanted a long-term improvement for the automated ordering process for us and our customers. It was time for an innovative solution!\nUwe Richter, Director Customer Service at HSE.\nIn addition to significantly improving the customer experience, HSE also had a clear commercial vision for the project: to build in cross-selling functionality for a phonebot.\nHSE launched the project with these requirements:\nUp to 600 automated calls needed to be able to be handled at the same time while integrating 10 different APIs from core systems such as their CRM, merchandise management, and payment system.\nCustomers needed to be able to decide for themselves whether to enter answers verbally or use the pre-existing keyboard shortcuts.\nThe full HSE product catalog needed to be mapped in a natural voice dialog to the target groups high demands.\nWhat is the solution?\nHSE considered the introduction of a conversational AI solution to be the perfect technological answer to address their challenges. They decided to implement a voice-based, automated ordering process that would allow customers to interact freely with a phonebot.\nHSE compared several AI-driven solutions on competitive performance benchmarking. Parloa and MUUUH! came out on top for both technology and voice user interface design.\nThis partnership facilitated the implementation of an automated customer dialog. Using HSEs Recommendation Engine, they were able to integrate the cross-sell functionality into the automated telephone ordering process.\nParloas intelligent phonebot went into operation just three months later.\nWhat are the results?\nAchieved a phonebot cross-sell rate of 10%\nAI-driven execution of up to 3 million calls per year, with up to 600 simultaneous calls\nImproved accessibility at peak times\nImproved customer experience\nWith Parloas Conversational AI platform and the voice experts from MUUUH!, HSE created a fully AI-controlled phonebot that completes order processes within minutes, reduces the workload for customer advisors, and shortens wait times for customers.\nWith the Parloa platform, we can now accept a large number of orders automatically. From product entry to individual details like product variations (colors, sizes), to storing payment methods, everything is easier thanks to voice control. And all orders are stored in HSEs linked CRM system\nUwe Richter Director Customer Service at HSE\nAnother game changer is the new cross-selling function, which allows AI to continuously query stock levels in order to immediately offer active users additional items related to the main product. Definitely one of the highlights! says Uwe Richter.\nHSEs EASY AI remains one of the most advanced, best-selling phonebots in Europe.", "source_url": "https://www.parloa.com/customers/hse/"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 11, "end": 16, "text": "Sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 68, "end": 80, "text": "24 July 2025", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 102, "end": 114, "text": "3M Automated", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 121, "end": 129, "text": "Annually", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "10%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1028, "end": 1045, "text": "just three months", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1182, "end": 1195, "text": "a few minutes", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1240, "end": 1261, "text": "the beginning of 2022", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1964, "end": 1981, "text": "conversational AI", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2098, "end": 2114, "text": "Customer Service", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2189, "end": 2208, "text": "more than 2 million", "labels": ["QUANTITY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2626, "end": 2642, "text": "Customer Service", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3020, "end": 3023, "text": "CRM", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3370, "end": 3387, "text": "conversational AI", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4040, "end": 4058, "text": "three months later", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4121, "end": 4124, "text": "10%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4437, "end": 4444, "text": "minutes", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4812, "end": 4822, "text": "CRM system", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4845, "end": 4861, "text": "Customer Service", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4539, "end": 4554, "text": "Parloa platform", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1836, "end": 1841, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4294, "end": 4311, "text": "Conversational AI", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 4294, "end": 4320, "text": "Conversational AI platform", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "Swiss Life Transforms Support with AI Phone Bot\nHome > customers > Article\n24 July 2025  3 mins\nStatistics:\n96% routing accuracy\n60% faster at addressing customer concerns\n100% access to expert knowledge\nAbout the company\nSwiss Life Germany is a leading provider of financial and long-term savings solutions. It offers private and corporate clients individually tailored solutions in the areas of insurance, pensions and investments.The company is headquartered in Hannover.\nThe bottom line\nThe era of touch-tone IVRs (Interactive voice response) is over for Swiss Lifes hotline. Since the introduction of an AI-powered phone bot powered by Parloa, the company has been able to answer calls 60% faster. The result: a streamlined service experience and happier employees thanks to intelligent routing during peak and off-peak hours.\nThe challenge was to create a routing logic that was as individual as the support we provide and as agile as our mindset. We were able to do this with Parloa.\nTom Schneider Consultant for Process and Project Management at Swiss Life\nWhat was the challenge?\nPress one for  the traditional touch-tone IVR message of the Swiss Life hotline greeted callers in a friendly manner but with minimal and rigid choices.\nAs a result, customers and sales associates had limited access to the companys extensive financial and service offerings. They had to wait on hold for the right information or employees with the appropriate expertise.\nSwiss Life Service Center employees needed a simpler way to share niche and expert knowledge with customers  flexibly and across multiple use cases. In addition, it should be possible to deploy teams more flexibly to relieve them, especially at peak times.\nThe experience was suffering for both customers and employees. An extensive restructuring investigation revealed the solution:\nA modern, scalable phone bot solution was needed.\nThese were the objectives of Swiss Life:\nMake service and expertise available through optimized routing\nManage peak loads during periods of increased call volume\nFaster and more intuitive solutions for callers Improved caller experience.\nWhat is the solution?\nConversational AI has taken the quality and capabilities of phone bot conversations to the next level. Swiss Life saw it as an ideal solution to optimize the quality of service for callers, support employees and share expertise.\nSwiss Life, therefore, decided to integrate artificial intelligence into its telephone solutions  in close cooperation with the consulting agency MUUUH!.\nSwiss Life tested several Conversational AI-based platforms in search of a partner with the technical expertise and cultural fit. Parloa was a winning combination becuse of its s extensive experience in Conversational AI and delivering high-quality dialog And the chemistry was right!\nThe kickoff began, and it was immediately apparent that close collaboration with the customer care team would be necessary for a successful transition. After all, who else in the company knows more about what customers want?\nStep by step, the Swiss Life team identified possible keywords and user intent options. They began a process of extensive testing and refinement with each successive draft.\nA team of experts was responsible for training our AI phone bot. Our employees have a good understanding of what customers frequently ask, and theyre also the people who receive feedback from them. So they know whats important to include in conversations.\nTom Schneider Process and Project Management Officer at Swiss Life Germany\nSwiss Life launched the pilot in one of its four sales divisions. After it proved successful, they rolled out the AI phone bot to all sales departments.\nWhat are the results?\n96% Routing accuracy\nCallers reach their requests 60% faster\n73% of all respondents rated the phone bot 4 or 5 (out of 5)\nExpert knowledge is readily available\nImproved caller experience\nA traditional IVR solution quickly reaches its limits with only nine available numbers. The intelligent AI phone bot could handle far more caller requests.\nThe flexible AI-based speech recognition makes it easy for callers to communicate their concerns, even if they dont know the right terminology. They can get in touch with the right person quickly and easily., Tom Schneider.\nParloas conversational AI platform efficiently manages contact center peaks and reduces employee workload. It intelligently distributes basic customer queries to the appropriate employees. Questions that require niche or expert knowledge end up in the hands of Swiss Lifes specialists. All in record time.\nOutlook\nSwiss Lifes milestone phone bot: what does the future hold? In the short term, the company plans to make its AI solution even more customer-friendly, introduce claims reporting via the phone bot, and develop more efficient claims handling for large claims.\nSwiss Life was proactive in retiring its touch-tone IVR. The company was rewarded quickly with a better caller and employee experience. Their service center anticipates a new future full of opportunities that will provide them with a significant competitive advantage in the insurance industry.\nWith the Parloa platforms low-code front-end, it is no longer necessary to involve Swiss Lifes IT department. Employees can change routing, keywords and intentions themselves  intuitively and without any programming knowledge.\nTom Schneider Process and Project Management Officer at Swiss Life Germany",

that can handle a wide variety of box sizes was a real challenge. In our case, Stretch can unload everything that we bring in a loose-loaded form.\nSupplementing the existing manual unloading process with automation gives a higher rate of consistency and helps to meet the service level agreements we promise - independently from external influences that might occur.\nImproving safety and employee health\nStretchs design also prioritizes employee safety, which is an important point for us. It uses lidar technology to create a virtual safety zone, automatically shutting down if anyone approaches too closely.\nBeing fully mobile, the robot significantly reduces infrastructure costs and simplifies training for our employees. The single robotic arm, which is equipped with a vacuum gripper of suction cups that can be individually actuated for optimal suction on each box, paired with the advanced vision system that allows it to analyze boxes in real time, the robot can unload and place boxes safely on a conveyor for further processing. It can even pick and place a multiple number of smaller boxes, which significantly reduces unloading times.\n\"Stretch can work with anything that's a box,\" said Spenser Brouwer, Director of Customer Solutions and Integration at Boston Dynamics. \"As long as it's shaped like a cardboard box, Stretch can handle it.

However, especially due to the strong growth in e-commerce business, the shipping volume has risen continuously in recent years. Since around 32,000 orders per hour were received via all systems at peak times, the DOUGLAS Group decided on a holistic omnichannel strategy in order to interlink the branch and online business even more closely and thus optimize the customer journey. At the heart of the new solution is our omnichannel hub, which, in contrast to the decentralized approach, enabled higher availability of products with a shorter delivery time.\nTo do this, the existing logistics concept had to be revised, which consisted of a fulfillment center for e-commerce and five cross-docking centers for deliveries to the stores for the DACH region. An additional challenge was the diverse range of products offered by the DOUGLAS Group.

Headquartered in London, they have 70 restaurants across the UK.\nChallenges\nTeam struggled to manage demand during peak operating hours and high-value holidays, often resulting in missed booking inquiries and unrealized revenue potential\nSolution\nA scalable AI agent, available 24/7 across all locations, designed to capture every booking opportunity and drive revenue by ensuring no call goes unanswered\nResult\n3,000 monthly reservations created by AI agent, with 76% booking call conversion rate and 72% call reduction to employees\nChallenge\nAs every restaurant owner knows, missed calls mean missed revenue. Cte leadership estimated they werent answering 12% of calls because front-of-house staff were overwhelmed during opening hours and customers calling after business hours couldnt get a response. This problem was further exacerbated during special occasions like Valentines Day and Mothers Day, when call volumes spiked and the team couldnt keep up with the demand for reservations while also managing increased footfall.\nCte Brasserie also needed help making their employment strategies more efficient. The seasonality of the restaurant industry required the company to ramp up for peak seasons and scale down afterwards without compromising service. This inefficient employment model caused challenges for the companys bottom line.\nTo alleviate these issues, Cte Brasserie required an AI agent that was always accessible, scalable across all locations, and capable of driving revenue to ensure no reservation calls were missed. Additionally, the solution needed to alleviate the workload on staff by managing routine guest requests while providing a welcoming experience.\nThe selected partner would also need to integrate with OpenTable, a significant driver of reservations.\n\"We were initially skeptical about handing over guest conversations to AI, but Joe (our AI agent) quickly proved himself a valuable member of the team with his warmth, efficiency and quality service.\" \nSolution\nCte Brasserie partnered with PolyAI to implement an AI agent that is universally available, including after hours. The PolyAI agent, named Joe, has significantly improved Cte Brasseries operations by ensuring no calls go unanswered and every interaction enhances the brand experience with consistency and quality. Guests can now effortlessly make, modify, or cancel reservations through the PolyAI agent. These functionalities have unlocked new revenue opportunities for Cte Brasserie that would have previously been missed.\nAdditionally, the PolyAI agent can handle common customer inquiries, such as restaurant location, loyalty program, and dietary requests. This reduces the workload on restaurant staff, allowing them to concentrate on delivering an outstanding dining experience for guests.\n76% \nReservation call conversion rate\n72% \nCall reduction to employees\n3000 \nMonthly reservations created by AI Agent\nThe implementation of the PolyAI agent has led to significant improvements in the Cte Brasseries operations and guest experiences. Following a successful rollout, the PolyAI agent has already achieved an impressive 76% successful reservation rate on calls that would have previously been missed. Additionally, the AI agent automates 72% of all calls, maximizing revenue generation by empowering customers to make reservations and have their questions answered. \nThe PolyAI agent has led to substantial cost savings for Cte Brasserie and enhanced the efficiency of the table reservation process. Staff are more focused, guests are better supported, and the phone has gone from bottleneck to brand asset. Additionally, the teams are aware that incoming calls are likely to be high-value interactions, such as large group reservations, rather than routine inquiries that do not require their immediate attention. PolyAI and Cte Brasserie are already planning the next stage of development, with plans to increase adoption and deepen integrations to drive greater efficiency, guest satisfaction, and revenue capture. \nWith PolyAI, were giving guests a better experience while removing pressure from our teams.

The business is committed to providing exceptional dining experiences, which meant that staff prioritised guests on-site, with little time to answer the phone. As a result, the restaurants were missing 60% of all calls, leading to potential lost revenue from missed new booking calls.\nSarah Pope, CIO/IT Director at the Big Table Group, began looking at ways to innovate and digitise their phone lines. She wanted to deliver a competitive customer experience, take the pressure off restaurant staff, and increase the amount of reservations they could take over the phone.\nDesigning a voice assistant to take reservations without staff\nUnderstanding customers however they talk\nPolyAI worked with the Big Table Group to develop a customer-led voice assistant that can take, amend, and cancel restaurant reservations, as well as answer FAQs throughout the conversation.\nTogether, we created a custom voice for the assistant that provides a consistent, friendly, and welcoming conversational experience that feels like talking to a real-life member of staff. The voice assistant is designed to allow customers the flexibility to speak naturally while guiding them through the booking process.\nCallers can speak as they would with a real member of staff, saying things like next Thursday at noon or booking for me and my partner instead of explicitly stating a date, time, and number of guests.\nWhen no tables are available, the voice assistant can negotiate with the caller to find another time or location that suits, ensuring that no opportunity is missed. The voice assistant also collects information about which menu guests would like to dine from, as well as allergy information to note on the booking.\nIntegrating with booking platform Zonal\nThe Big Table Group manages reservations through Zonal, so it was vital that the solution could integrate with the platform. PolyAI was an easy choice for them, having already proven their success in the UK restaurant industry with other deployments also taking reservations on the Zonal platform.\nScaling across brands, locations, and use cases\nThe deployment began small, starting with ten sites across the Bella Italia and Cafe Rouge brands. PolyAI is now taking reservations for the Big Table Group in 130 restaurant locations across 3 of their core brands around the UK, with more due to roll out in 2024.\nAs part of the expansion, additional use cases were developed, including the ability for restaurants to take a card guarantee for large parties and for their popular bottomless brunches.\nThe initial build and deployment of the voice assistant was seamless - all we needed to do was provide the information and a few API keys. The rollout to other locations and brands has been really easy too, its like a well-oiled machine now. \n3800 \nreservations per month\n140000+ \nfrom phone bookings\nPolyAI is now live across Amalfi, Bella Italia, Cafe Rouge, and Las Iguanas brands, talking to customers and taking reservations every day. The Big Table Group is now able to answer every call, booking on average 3,800 reservations per month and contributing 140,000+ from bookings made over the phone across the three restaurant brands. Restaurant staff are now dedicated to providing great customer service on-site without their phones constantly ringing in the background. Through the voice assistant, the Big Table Group now has access to detailed conversational data into why customers are calling and what theyre asking about.

Atos provides tailored end-to-end solutions for all industries in 69 countries.\nAtos handles the entire end-to-end banking operation of a government-backed financial service, including all customer service channels and aspects of technology. The partnership is directed toward building a self-service digital business that enhances efficiency and scales operations to serve millions of customers.\nChallenge\nEffectively handle seasonal and unpredictable demand peaks while delivering engaging customer experiences at scale.\nSolution\nIntroduce a voice assistant to answer customer FAQs, support a digital-first strategy, and connect complex customer queries to highly skilled agents.\nResult\nA reduction in agent call volumes by 30%, creating additional capacity to focus highly skilled agents on complex customer queries. Reducing wait times, improving customer service, and enhancing colleague wellbeing.\nChallenge\nPrior to the PolyAI implementation, the Atos Customer Interaction Centers (CIC) had a standard touch-tone IVR routing calls to 440 agents. Their contract with the government-backed financial service mandated 24-hour service over the phone, 365 days a year.\nMeeting the demand of highly volatile call volumes and 24/7/365 service proved difficult to staff for. During slower periods, they found they were overstaffed by up to 60%, but in busy periods, there were not enough people to answer calls, resulting in rising call abandonment rates, wait times of 15+ minutes, and frustrated customers.\nPolyAI has allowed us to accommodate periods of peak customer activity and to minimize complaints by significantly increasing our ability to answer FAQs through the voice assistant \nOn top of regularly high call volumes, two-factor authentication was introduced to increase customer security. Atos anticipated that this update would increase their call volume as a large percentage of their customer demographic are non-digital natives. Hiring additional staff to address these volumes in a tough labor market wasnt an option.\nIts one of the most difficult recruitment markets theres ever been. We cant just go out and recruit 300 people like we would have done five years ago, said Louise Coe, Head of Performance, Atos.\nWith a dedicated continuous improvement team, they realized a need for a solution that could scale up and down with call volumes to make demand peaks more manageable and reduce overstaffing during quiet times.\nWith these challenges considered, Atos worked with PolyAI to implement a voice assistant to handle consistently high call volume while delivering an engaging customer experience.\nIncreasing contact center capacity with a customer-led voice assistant\nThe goal of the voice assistant was to help customers get the right answers to their queries with increased consistency and reduced wait times while continuing to offer friendly and understanding agents to help with more complex customer questions.\nIn the space of 8 weeks, PolyAI helped us achieve that goal by building and deploying the voice assistant, said Danny Penswick, Customer Interaction Center, Senior Operations Manager.\nEngaging customers in natural conversations\nWith a customer base of primarily non-digital natives, it was crucial for the voice assistant to engage with every caller naturally, allowing them to speak how they like and be understood regardless of the words they use, their accent, and background noise.\nOften, customers like to give backstory and context to their queries, which meant the voice assistant had to allow callers to explain themselves in their own words, interrupt, and ask questions at any point in the conversation.\nBy providing helpful responses and allowing the customer flexibility throughout the conversation, the voice assistant builds trust. This keeps customers in the conversation instead of requesting to speak to an agent.\nThis was especially important as customers were calling in relation to their finances and needed reassurance they were receiving the right guidance.\nPolyAI has allowed us to automate the telephony service in a way that doesn't feel like automation to customers; we even get positive feedback about the AI interactions \nDanny Penswick\nCustomer Interaction Center, Senior Operations Manager at Atos\nTreating customers with empathy\nCalls range from routine queries about accessing application forms to more complex and sensitive calls about bereavement. The voice assistant is designed to adjust its tone of voice according to the customers needs and guides callers to a solution, even during difficult and sensitive calls.\nMeeting security standards\nAs a financial institution, security checks were an essential part of the 8-week build and deployment process. PolyAI voice assistants have ISO27001, SOC-2 Type 2, Cyber Essentials, PCI, and HIPAA certifications. PolyAI worked closely with Atos to ensure the necessary steps were taken to meet regulatory and security standards.\n30% \nreduction in agent call volumes\nEfficiently scaling support \nThe PolyAI voice assistant handles the workload equivalent to between 50-95 full-time agents depending on call volume, representing approximately 12-23% of the UK Customer Interaction Centers headcount and at 50% of the cost of an FTE. Answering thousands of calls simultaneously proved invaluable at managing peaks, fully containing 30% of repetitive calls normally handled by contact center agents. \nThe fact we had Customer Service Representatives freed up with PolyAI doing the job helped us increase capacity while still offering a saving to our customer. \nLouise Coe\nHead of Performance at Atos\nAgent well-being and round-the-clock support\nBefore the introduction of the voice assistant, Atos colleagues supported customers 24/7/365. This led to a variety of shift patterns, including overnight, weekend, and Christmas Day working.\nThrough the introduction of the voice assistant. Atos and their client reviewed and reduced the times they required agent support. The voice assistant provided support outside of core hours and allowed Atos to refocus their people on supporting customers during condensed hours.\nImplementing this change enabled Atos to improve CSR well-being and work-life balance while also helping with recruiting and retaining the right people.\nWe used to have to work on Christmas day, but with PolyAI answering calls 24/7/365, were able to close on public holidays - much to the delight of our team! \nDanny Penswick\nCustomer Interaction Center, Senior Operations Manager at Atos\nUpskilling and redeploying agents\nWith the voice assistant handling repetitive calls, Atos is using the time gained back to commit to strengthening agents skills and enhancing customer and colleague experiences.\nThe call center tends to be an entry into the organization. Its allowed us to develop people into other roles. Working in the call center, they get to know all the products inside out, and they get to move into high-risk transactions teams or fraud prevention roles. It tends to be a gateway into the business, said John Murphy, Director of Customer Service, Atos.\nThe PolyAI voice assistant has allowed us to take a lot of people, develop them into more specialist roles, and replace the CIC function with AI, said John.\nTaking the IVR out was a big win for employee experience. It allowed us to take people who were basically answering FAQs and redeploy them to handle more complicated transactions \nJohn Murphy\nDirector of Customer Service at Atos \nShifting agent time from low to high-value calls\nPolyAI understood the importance of handling low-value calls, including out-of-hours, to give agents a better work-life balance and give time back to handle more complex, high-value calls with care.\nBy letting callers speak however they like and providing helpful responses at every step of the conversation, the voice assistant builds trust and keeps customers engaged when answering FAQs.", "source_url": "https://poly.ai/case-studies/atos/"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 175, "end": 181,

Simplyhealth approached PolyAI to build a voice assistant that could serve customers efficiently and treat vulnerable customers with extra care.\nCreating a unique brand voice\nPolyAI understood the importance of creating a natural, dynamic voice that Simplyhealths callers would want to engage with. The voice assistant needed to be unique to the brand and bolster their image as a trusted advisor.\nSimplyhealth worked with PolyAI to co-create a voice assistant\nthat sounded genuine, and could clearly explain online processes. The voice assistant is designed to adjust its tone of voice according to the customers needs, and guides callers to a solution, even during difficult and sensitive calls.\nThis is next-level conversational AI, and its far and away better than anything else Ive heard in the market. \nMaximizing self-service through natural language understanding\n75% of calls managed by Simplyhealths contact center are FAQs that can be solved using digital self-service channels. However, customers continue to call  especially digitally vulnerable customers who rely on the phone channel to access support.\nTo deliver genuinely helpful support, the voice assistant had to earn the customers trust. This meant understanding callers regardless of what they say and how they say it. This was crucial as digitally vulnerable customers would explain their claims at great length and in a way that felt natural.\nInstead of telling customers to repeat themselves or just go online, like a traditional IVR, the PolyAI voice assistant engaged callers in conversation to understand their queries fully.\nGuiding callers through a natural conversation and making them feel understood gave them more confidence that they could resolve their problems without speaking to an agent.\nFor callers with online access, the voice assistant provides an SMS containing a direct link to Simplyhealths online resources that specifically answer their questions. This approach encourages customers to self-serve while reducing the number of repetitive call types managed by their agents.\nWhen the voice assistant identifies a customer without online access, it can ask for more information about the issue to ensure the call gets routed to the right person.\nIts the best and most seamless tech implementation Ive ever experienced. \nDan Eddie\nCustomer Service Director at Simplyhealth\nThe PolyAI voice assistant is now handling an average of 5,500 calls each week on Simplyhealths consumer line. 25% of calls are fully resolved by providing answers to frequently asked questions or directing callers to the most appropriate online resources. By reducing the volume of repetitive calls to the contact center, Simplyhealth can deploy staff to business areas where resources are needed the most, and digitally-vulnerable customers can receive a dedicated service more efficiently. Now that the call center has more capacity, Simplyhealth has changed the process for customers who need to order a paper claim form. Instead of being transferred to a voicemail, theyre now transferred straight to an agent for a more personal experience. \nThe PolyAI voice assistant is now a part of how we speak to our customers on a day-to-day basis. Our customers love it because it means that they can save time and effort. They dont have to wait on the phone to get through to an agent. \nDan Eddie\nCustomer Service Director at Simplyhealth\nThe future for PolyAI and Simplyhealth\nSimplyhealth has big ambitions for their digital transformation journey.

multi-billion-dollar ad platform\n3-MINUTE READ\nSeptember 12, 2024\nUbers convenience, now for advertisers: A $1 billion success story\nSince its founding, Uber has revolutionized industries by making experiences simple, intuitive, and personalized and by removing friction from the customer journey.\nIn keeping with their customer-centric focus, Uber set out to deliver even more personalized experiences by revolutionizing another industry: advertising.\nWith 156 million monthly active users, Uber uses its global insights to create a hyper-personalized ad platform that connects advertisers with the right consumers in the moments that matter.\nPicture this: youre arriving at work on an Uber trip when an ad gives you a discount for your go-to coffee shop next door. Or on your Uber ride home, an ad reminds you that your favorite TV show has a new season coming out next week. (Better buy some popcorn.) Thats the innovation Uber is bringing to advertisers.\nSince launching a new Uber advertising division in 2022, the platform has already surpassed an impressive US$1 billion in annual revenue run rate. But Ubers rapid expansion wasnt all smooth riding. The ads business was established quickly and had to move rapidly to meet its goals. This quick expansion and growth saw some employees hindered by manual processes, and teams struggled to keep up with the pace and volume of demand from advertisers. Thats why Uber partnered with Accenture to unify its disparate processes and smooth out the barriers that were slowing them down.\nA simple approach for a complex environment\nUber and Accenture started by defining a new end-to-end ad sales process globally. Then, as part of a book-to-bill program, a digital solution was built on Salesforce Media Cloud, centralizing Ubers ad sales operations and consolidating its customer data into one system. The team then integrated other third-party tools into Media Cloud, eliminating the need to juggle multiple tools to do straightforward tasks.\nNext, Uber onboarded global sales groups into Media Cloud, moved and modernized over 100 processes in the cloud, and created over 75 custom dashboards to give teams visibility into operations. To facilitate these changes, the team devised and delivered training and upskilling programs for Ubers sales teams.\nBy managing ad sales end-to-end through a single platform, Uber now saves time and increases efficiency, helping teams focus on business strategy and selling. And the gridlock of manually kept spreadsheets and decentralized systems? Theyre in the rear-view mirror.\nUber is now intaking advertising demand 50% faster and the speed of their end-to-end ad sales process has increased by nearly 70%.\nA new roadmap\nThis is just the beginning of our journey together. Going forward, Uber will continue to expand Media Clouds scale while increasing gen AI integrations, including helping advertisers manage their campaigns and automating campaign optimization. These advancements are creating the worlds easiest-to-use, self-serve ad platformand making advertising as simple as getting a ride via the Uber app.\nDiscover how Accenture is reinventing ad sales and marketing with strategy and activation plans that boost revenues, click here.", "source_url": "https://www.accenture.com/us-en/case-studies/software-platforms/uber-new-era-advertising"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 160, "end": 180, "text": "multi-billion-dollar", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 193, "end": 201, "text": "3-MINUTE", "labels": ["TIME"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 207, "end": 232, "text": "September 12, 2024\nUbers", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 269, "end": 279, "text": "$1 billion", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 631, "end": 638, "text": "monthly", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1029, "end": 1038, "text": "next week", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "text": "2022", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1228, "end": 1240, "text": "US$1 billion", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1244, "end": 1250, "text": "annual", "labels": ["DATE"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2079, "end": 2084, "text": "Cloud", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2213, "end": 2218, "text": "Cloud", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2267, "end": 2272, "text": "cloud", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2777, "end": 2780, "text": "50%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2856, "end": 2866, "text": "nearly 70%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2984, "end": 2991, "text": "Clouds", "labels": ["PERSON"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3015, "end": 3021, "text": "gen AI", "labels": ["TECHNOLOGY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 269, "end": 271, "text": "$1", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1230, "end": 1232, "text": "$1", "labels": ["MONEY"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2863, "end": 2866, "text": "70%", "labels": ["PERCENT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1805, "end": 1810, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 1949, "end": 1954, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2189, "end": 2194, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2458, "end": 2463, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2486, "end": 2491, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 2825, "end": 2830, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 3320, "end": 3325, "text": "sales", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}, {"from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 674, "end": 682, "text": "insights", "labels": ["PRODUCT"]}}], "score": 0.85}]}, {"data": {"text": "Transforming our collaboration culture with Microsoft 365  Arvato\nFrom siloed teams to a global collaboration culture \nAs we grow and become more global, its necessary for us to bring our people together digitally, harmonize on one platform, and encourage everyone to create solutions and share their knowledge.

We are working toward a cloud-first strategy as the basis for global collaboration and operational excellence. Bringing together skilled people and innovative technology - our culture is defined by the delivery of operational excellence with a strong client focus.\nOne of our largest migration projects was to reduce the complexity and improve the stability of SAP environments in the cloud. At the beginning of 2023, we completed a full migration of our large-scale SAP systems, including the SAP S/4HANA environment, to Microsoft Azure - a platform that is perfectly aligned with our modern workplace strategy. To ensure resilient processes for our clients, we chose Microsoft Azure for SAP versus being multicloud, offering us the flexibility, adaptability, and cost-saving features we need for our modern workplace.\nSpeeding up processes\nAs we locked in our move to SAP on the Microsoft cloud, we prioritized migrating our global production systems and the infrastructure supporting our logistics services for clients across Europe, Asia and the United States. These systems must be continuously available, so we especially benefitted from the Azure platforms ease of adoption and extensive capabilities. We managed to accomplish all of the Azure migrations in one step, moving on-premises workloads to SAP S/4HANA on Azure over a single weekend. Our goal for each migration and upgrade to S/4 was to keep downtime as short as possible, and we did it in less than 48 hours while using Azure ExpressRoute to scale up our transfer of more than 4 terabytes of pure system data to the cloud and using our optimized approach to ensure a simultaneous S/4 upgrade. With our warehouse processes and related tasks driven by SAP systems, every level of the organization now benefits from enhanced infrastructure offerings on Azure.\nWhen maintenance or patching is required, systems can be taken offline and turned on again within a weekend. We can also set up new environments from scratch in 10 minutes, down from hours. Both time-saving measures help us to ensure uninterrupted operations of scanners, scales, forklifts, and other warehouse equipment and associated data, all of which come in contact with our SAP systems and infrastructure. We did all of this work on time and within budget with no rollbacks and limited re-architecting of our processes and data.\nMore flexibility  less complexity\nPost-migration, we used Azure to meet our long-term goal of reducing and consolidating dozens of domains.

Our unique platform takes that demand away:\nAny member of your team can manage your AI assistant (you dont need any technical skill)\nYour security and compliance responsibilities are all taken care of  even if theyre extensive\nYou can easily add new features to scale AI-driven support over time\nTheres a human in the loop to help continuously improve your AI assistants performance\nAll anyone needs to get started is a website url  its that simple!\nAn advanced AI assistant helps B&D bring down call volumes while keeping standards high\nBefore launching their AI assistant, B&D wanted to find a way to reduce phone enquiries, but didnt want to reduce the quality of their service. They hoped using an AI assistant would help them:\nSpend more time and resource on the problems residents need the council for the most\nBetter serve residents who have complex needs\nSupport more residents without increasing fixed costs\nOffer a more efficient service delivery\nImprove overall user experience\nB&D chose a name for their AI assistant and a custom avatar, and have full control over every response it sends out to their local community, which can be edited any time.\nEverything B&D needs to check their AI assistants progress is on their client dashboard:\n(Data shown is for illustrative purposes only) \nCustomer support is easily tailored to the London council and its customers using AI\nB&D were excited to discover their AI assistant can handle scheduling enquiries like these from start to finish:\nWhen does my bin get collected?\nWhat day does my recycling bin get taken?\nIs my bin collected the same time each week?\nTo handle these enquiries independently, the AI assistant was trained to first ask for the customers postcode. Using a simple integration, it can then query the councils back-office systems to return the customers next bin collection date. 98% of these kinds of enquiries are now fully resolved using just the AI assistant.\n9 months after launch the AI assistant is trained to answer queries for 6 departments\nB&D quickly reported a 6% reduction in calls about missed bins, so the AI assistant was trained to answer enquiries for another five departments on all sorts of topics from council tax and housing, to births, deaths and marriages. This soon highlighted the most popular topics in each area, like parking ticket disputes, visitor parking, and missed bins, so the council now knows where to focus its resource. The best part is, it didnt cost them any more to use the same AI assistant to take on more departments and tasks.\nCustomer satisfaction increased by 67%\nOnly 20% of customers reported successfully using the B&D website to resolve their query, yet in its first six months, the B&D AI assistant handled 18,400 enquiries from customers and 87% of those were successfully resolved, meaning the AI assistant understood their request correctly AND gave them a helpful answer without any input from the B&D contact centre team. The early success rate exceeded all expectations.\nAI automation is popular with residents\nIn its first nine months the B&D AI assistant had 21,000 conversations with customers. The council saw people quickly gain confidence with using it and the AI assistant started to average 3,280 meaningful conversations with residents every quarter. This number will only continue to go up, the more the AI assistant is trained to do.\nB&D gives 24-hour help to its community\nHaving an AI assistant online all through the day and night quickly showed B&D 35% of their queries come in outside of their office hours. They want customers to be able to contact them at a time most convenient for them, and getting to know customer preferences through the use of AI means B&D can quickly adapt their services to suit, increasing customer satisfaction.\nCouncil savings are on the up\nThe B&D contact centre gets 40,000 customer queries a month and in six months their AI assistant handled 10,000 of those  thats a massive saving on council spending. B&D allocated resource to automating more tasks like applications for visitor parking and the contact team now has more time to focus on sensitive enquiries or difficult issues where customers appreciate the human touch.\nConversation review is essential to B&D's success\nOur team of conversation analysts are continually reviewing conversations between B&D residents and their AI assistant, looking for patterns to see where improvements can be made.\nConversation review helps guide decisions the council makes, showing where services can improve and what takes priority. All they have to do is accept (or reject) our suggestions on the platform.\nB&Ds return on their investment (ROI) is 533% and the more people use the AI assistant for the increasing number of tasks it can do, the more the council expects this figure to go up.\nSince call numbers have decreased dramatically, B&D is now looking at ways to decrease email volume too, which will also increase ROI.",

costs, optimize workflows and improve patient care\nChallenged to realize the full potential of its data, a leading U.S.-based healthcare company partnered with CGI to explore and build solutions that leverage AI and GenAI to drive better outcomes and lower costs for patients, providers and health plans.\nThe challenge\nA U.S.-based healthcare company that provides medical benefits management faced significant challenges in meeting its mission to enable evidence-based care decisions. Hindered by the stability and quality of its data, hundreds of data points and manual processes, the company needed to improve its operational efficiency and enable faster and more informed decision-making.\nTo tackle this challenge, the company turned to CGI for guidance on maximizing its data's full potential. The partnership enabled the team to focus on increasing data availability and providing the tools to build and deploy machine learning models powered by GenAI for multiple use cases to improve health services.\nIt starts with data\nCGI began by migrating the healthcare companys data lake into the Databricks cloud-based platform on Azure. By refactoring the data and moving it to the cloud, the overall quality and stability of the data pipelines immediately increased.\nCGIs AI LaunchPadaccelerating AI value\nNext, to define its AI strategy, CGI supported the company with its proprietary framework for end-to-end AI capabilities to mitigate risk and leverage GenAI responsibly. The framework includes four imperatives for action, powered by CGIs AI LaunchPad, which accelerates AI projects, resulting in faster, more impactful and responsible AI deployments to drive business value.\nImperatives for action:\nEnvision: Define your AI vision\nExplore: Identify high-impact, ROI-led use cases\nEngineer: Build a scalable and adaptable AI foundation\nExpand: Accelerate value and operate responsibly\nThe journey began with the envision phase, during which the teams worked together to identify, assess and prioritize AI use cases. They also explored challenges and opportunities to shape the companys AI vision.\nIn the explore phase, subject matter experts and data scientists collaborated to evaluate and develop proof-of-concept solutionssuch as predicting oncology regimen costsdemonstrating how AI can process and synthesize vast amounts of data.\nAs the company matured on its AI implementation journey, it moved into the engineer and expand phases, focusing on improving patient care by connecting patients, providers and health plans. Leveraging GenAI, the team identified and developed impactful use cases to drive optimized healthcare outcomes. To streamline processes and optimize cost savings, the CGI team consistently made recommendations that the technology organization reviewed and adopted across multiple workflows. The close collaboration between CGI and the engineers was key to successful implementation across use cases.\nCGI enabled the healthcare company to explore opportunities to leverage AI and GenAI technology, building models and solutions that evaluate the accuracy of AI responses over timeresulting in critical business insights.\nAccelerating business value with three use cases\nAI-powered oncology cost forecasting and regimen reclassification \nChallenge:\nTo enhance cancer patient care, the company needed a better way to predict oncology regimen costs and identify mislabeled regimens in patient claim authorizations. Accurate predictions would improve budgeting for approved expenses, streamline workflows and optimize costs, ultimately increasing efficiency and saving time.\nSolution:\nCGI helped develop and implement an AI-powered cost forecasting model trained on historical oncology cases. By recognizing hidden patterns, it accurately projected total costs for current cases. Additionally, the team delivered a cancer regimen reclassification model that analyzed past authorizations to detect and correct mislabeled regimens, ensuring alignment with standard classifications.\nOutcomes:\nWith these AI-driven models, the company can now more effectively budget and plan. Their enhanced ability to reduce foreseeable oncology costs while ensuring accurate clinical data classification results in a regimen classification accuracy of 85%.\nClinical GenAI chatbot frees clinicians from manual processes and saves US$2.5 million annually \nChallenge:\nThe healthcare company needed to streamline its burdensome claims review process, which required nurses and doctors to search through a large number of faxed documents manually. This tedious and time-consuming process prevented clinicians from focusing on delivering patient care.\nSolution:\nCGI developed an AI-powered chatbot to assist clinicians in extracting key information from faxes, enabling quicker case decisions. Instead of manually searching through documents, clinicians could ask domain-specific questions like, What medications are listed? or What are the patients lab results? and receive answers instantly, eliminating time searching and scrolling. \nOutcomes:\nThe interactive AI chatbot reduces clinicians' manual effort, delivering concise and accurate information from large documents for faster, data-driven decision-making. This led to higher accuracy in claim approvals or denials, fewer customer service calls and an annual savings of US$2.5 million.\nPredicting physician calls with live call models \nChallenge:\nEvery time a physician called the healthcare benefits management company regarding a patient case, the associated support costs increased. With rising expenses per case, the company aimed to reduce unnecessary calls to its call center.\nSolution:\nCGI developed AI-powered predictive models to assess the likelihood of physicians calling during various health plan adjudication steps. The company identified the key reasons behind 80% of calls using live call prediction models and AI-powered analytics dashboards. This allowed them to proactively provide information, reducing the need for physician-initiated inquiries.\nOutcomes:\nThe predictive models enabled significant time and cost savings per case while optimizing call center operations. By predicting and eliminating the need for multiple calls, physicians can focus on higher-value tasks that improve patient care.\nDelivering powerful business outcomes\nBy leveraging AI and GenAI-powered solutions, the company can now rapidly and accurately analyze large, complex datasets, enabling data-driven decision-making in key areas such as cost prediction, regimen recommendations and claims review. \nThese advanced AI solutions have delivered significant benefits, including:\nOptimized costs: Predictive analytics to forecast and reduce expenses.\nIncreased efficiency: Automated workflows and AI-driven insights to streamline operations.\nEnhanced decision-making: Greater data accuracy and AI-supported decision processes across the organization.\nImproved services: Comprehensive models incorporating clinical, social and geographic data to drive evidence-based outcomes.\nWorking with a trusted partner for continued success\nWith CGI as its trusted partner, the outlook for improving medical benefits management through innovative, value-added service capabilities is promising. The healthcare company has continued developing additional use casespowered by robust GenAI solutionsenabling key operational insights that drive unprecedented business outcomes.\nIn addition to empowering medical benefits management, CGIs AI LaunchPad helps organizations rapidly identify, design, validate and deploy AI solutions.
